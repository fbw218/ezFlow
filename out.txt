Mission Statement
To advance learning through the integration of teaching, research, and
service to others.

Other hot links

Excellence is the hallmark of a university of distinction. Excellence
requires a total quality commitment, which must characterize every
activity of Lehigh University.

www.lehigh.edu/catalog

Lehigh is an independent, coeducational university with programs in the
arts and humanities, business, education, engineering, and the natural
and social sciences, offering bachelor’s degrees primarily to full-time,
residential students and graduate degrees through the doctorate for both
full-time and part-time students. Lehigh is small enough to be personal,
yet large enough to provide stimulating diversity and to play important
national and international roles.

www.lehigh.edu/programs

Since Lehigh’s founding in 1865, the faculty has emphasized the
integration of the academic disciplines, combining the cultural with
the professional, the theoretical with the practical, and the humanistic
with the technological in a modern, liberal education that serves as
preparation for a useful life. Lehigh is an intellectually unified community
of learners, and in this sense Lehigh is an integral university.
Lehigh strives to earn international prominence as a university of special
distinction through its integration of teaching, research, and service to
society. The integrating element of teaching, research and service is
learning, which is the principal mission of all members of the Lehigh
community. Our mission of advancing learning has three aspects:
Teaching. The development of future leaders in our global society
is first among Lehigh’s purposes and first among our achievements.
Preparation for leadership requires the best of teaching, in which both
mentor and student are so deeply engaged that they become joint
owners of the learning process.
Research. Lehigh is deeply committed to the creative search for new
understanding of nature and human society as an essential element
of the learning process. The scholarly inquiry and research of Lehigh
faculty and students add value to instruction on our campus, and
contribute to the distinction of our university.
Service. The special commitment of the Lehigh community to
experiential learning through service to others imbues the entire
university with a sense of purpose and value in the larger society.
Lehigh is extensively involved in developing partnerships with industry,
government and others in education and human services to meet the
needs of our society. In a societal sense, Lehigh is devoted to the
concepts of unity, community, and cooperative achievement.
Lehigh believes that its graduates must develop critical thinking and
effective communication as their habit; they must have both a broad
understanding of human affairs and a domain of true competence; they
are expected to live by a set of mature cultural and personal values,
accept the virtue of work as a vehicle of service, and have the will to live
and work with exceptional self-discipline.
Respect for human dignity is very important at Lehigh, a caring
community deeply committed to harmonious cultural diversity as an
essential element of the learning environment. In order that all members
of the Lehigh community might develop as effective and enlightened
citizens, the University encourages physical, social, ethical, and spiritual
development as well as rigorous intellectual development.

POLICY OF EQUALITY

Lehigh University provides equal opportunity on the basis of merit
without discrimination because of race, color, religious creed, ancestry,
national origin, age, handicap, sex, sexual orientation or union
membership.

Entrance Examinations
SAT/ACT: Each candidate for admission to the first-year class is
required to take either the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) or the
American College Test (ACT). Students are not required to sit for the
writing component of either exam. Students are required to submit their
scores directly to Lehigh through the College Board (CEEB code 2365).
It is not the responsibility of the high school guidance office to forward
the results.
The Committee on Admissions recommends that students take the
exam in the junior year and again as early as possible in the senior year.
In the evaluation process, the highest score in each category for the
SAT and/or ACT will be used regardless of the test date. In cases where
students have taken both the "old" and the "redesigned" SAT, tests will
be super-scored within the respective exams but not across them, i.e.
"old" with "old" and "redesigned" with "redesigned" but not "old" with
"redesigned."
It is recommended that students who plan to study a foreign language
take the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test for the
language they intend to study. Students interested in advanced
placement and/or receiving college credit in Chemistry, English, or a
Foreign Language should take the SAT Subject Tests or the SAT Writing

Section. Please read the Advanced Placement section (p. 8) for
specific requirements.
Test information and applications may be secured from high
school guidance offices, ACT, or the College Board. Additional
information can be found online at www.collegeboard.com (http://
www.collegeboard.com) or www.act.org (http://catalog.lehigh.edu/
informationofgeneralinterest/entranceexaminations/www.act.org).
Candidates should register for the tests no later than one month prior to
the test date (two months for candidates who will be tested in Europe,
Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia).
For applicants whose first language is not English, Lehigh additionally
requires the results of the TOEFL iBT (Test of English as a Foreign
Language Internet-Based exam) or the IELTS (International English
Language Testing System). The Committee on Admissions looks for
a minimum composite score of 90 on the TOEFL iBT or a minimum of
7.0 on the IELTS. Students whose composite score or sub-scores are
lower than Lehigh’s minimums are still considered for admission but
may be required to take additional English courses during their first-year
and/or during the summer semester prior to fall matriculation. Official
score reports should be sent to Lehigh by the testing agency. The most
up-to-date information on requirements for non-US citizens can be
found on the Lehigh Admissions website: www1.lehigh.edu/admissions/
undergrad/intl

Recommendations
The Office of Admissions requires, as part of a candidate’s file, a letter of
recommendation from the guidance counselor, principal, or headmaster
from the candidate’s school. One teacher recommendation is also
required. In addition to academic qualifications, recommendations
should address the candidate’s personal qualifications such as
character, intellectual motivation, participation in school activities, and
established habits of industry and dependability.

Admission and Deposit

Transfer Students

requirement for admission to any one of the three undergraduate
colleges.
While there are many elements that go into Lehigh’s holistic application
review, the Committee on Admissions will be aware of things such as (in
no particular order):
• Rank or relative rank in class
• The student’s grades within the context of the school environment
• Evidence of improvement or deterioration in grades during
the secondary school career with particular attention paid to
performance in senior year courses
• The quality of performance in courses that relate to the student’s
anticipated area of study
• The difficulty of courses taken with special attention given to courses
recognized as accelerated by national academic organizations
• Comments and recommendations from the principal, headmaster,
guidance counselor, teachers, or other professional educators within
the school system
• Extra-curricular/work experience with particular emphasis placed on
demonstrated leadership
• Demonstrated interest in Lehigh University
Admissions decisions are final and will be posted online via the
Applicant Student Portal for each student. An admitted student, in the
Regular Decision round, may secure a place in the entering class by
notifying the university that he or she intends to enroll at Lehigh and
by submitting the appropriate non-refundable enrollment deposit via
the Admitted Student Portal or postmarked through the US Postal
Service by May 1. A student admitted through the Early Decision rounds
must send notification and deposit by the date indicated in his or her
acceptance letter. This fee is applicable towards the fall-term bill.
Students who do not attend will forfeit their deposit.

Transfer Students
Each August, students who have attended another college or university
are admitted with advanced standing. Candidates for transfer admission
must meet the high school subject matter requirements prescribed for
incoming first-year students, and are required to have at least one year
of full-time study (a minimum of 24 credits completed prior to time of
enrollment at Lehigh) at another institution. Exceptions to fulfilling high
school requirements will be granted following the review of a college
level transcript. The academic performance at the college level is the
primary focus when giving consideration to admission.
Candidates who have been dropped for poor scholarship, who are not in
good standing, or who have been released for disciplinary reasons are
not eligible for admission.
Each candidate must submit an official transcript and course
descriptions from each institution attended. An admissions decision
cannot be made without this information. Applicants for the fall semester
should have their application submitted by March 1. Information
regarding transfer applications may be found at www.lehigh.edu/tapply.
Each application must be accompanied by an application fee of $70.
Students are encouraged to take an active role in seeing that the various
components of their admission application have arrived at the university.
Students will be notified by the Office of the Registrar as to the total
credits Lehigh will grant to the student in advanced standing.
HOUSING

Every effort is made to accommodate transfer student housing needs.
All students are required to live on-campus through the end of the
sophomore year. Contact the Office of Residential Services, Rathbone
Hall, Lehigh University, 63 University Drive, Bethlehem, PA 18015 or
call (610) 758-3500. This office also can provide information about
off-campus housing. Fraternities and sororities often have room for
members or boarders. Information on this option may be obtained
through the Assistant Dean for Fraternity and Sorority Affairs (http://
studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/ofsa/contact).

Advanced Placement
The university offers capable students who have superior preparation
an opportunity for advanced placement and/or college credit. Many

secondary schools, in association with the College Board, offer collegelevel work. Students participating in these courses should sit for the
Advanced Placement Tests offered by the College Board.
Entering first-year students that request the College Board to send
their Advanced Placement Test scores to Lehigh are considered for
advanced placement.
Some departments noted below offer examinations during Freshman
Orientation to students who studied college-level subjects in secondary
school but did not sit for the Advanced Placement Tests. Entering
first-year students wishing to sit for an examination in any Lehigh
course should notify the Office of the First-Year Experience via email at
fye@lehigh.edu by the date given on the First-Year Student Portal. The
student should specify the number and title of the course. Students who
receive credit on the basis of Advanced Placement Test grades need not
sit for the Lehigh tests to confirm the credit granted.
Current practice at Lehigh is as follows:
Art, Architecture and Design
Eight credit hours for ART 001 and ART 002 are granted to students

Estimate of Expense for Undergraduates
Principally three areas of income support the operating expense of
Lehigh University: tuition and fees, endowment earnings, and gifts and
grants. The university is conscious that educational costs are significant
and it strives to maintain a program of high quality instruction while
recognizing that there are limitations on what families can afford to pay.
Costs will vary somewhat from student to student depending upon the
various options chosen.
TUITION, ROOM, AND BOARD

There are three major plans that cover the major expense associated
with university attendance. These are as follows:
The Tuition Plan

The university provides comprehensive academic and student services
under its tuition plan. The tuition sum is inclusive of most athletic
events, basic treatments in the Health Center, libraries, and laboratory
services. A technology fee of $400 is charged to all full-time students.
An additional $500 fee is charged to all students enrolled in the College

9

of Engineering and Applied Science or with a declared major in natural
science. The full-time tuition rate is charged to students enrolled in
twelve or more credit hours per semester. For students enrolled in less
than twelve credit hours, tuition is charged on a per-credit-hour basis.
University Housing Plan

A variety of living arrangements are available. The university provides
housing for approximately 2,500 students on campus in a wide selection
of residence facilities and approximately 900 students in fraternity and
sorority housing. The housing arrangements are grouped within four
basic categories, with rates associated with the category level. First
and second year students are required to reside in university housing.
Second year students may choose residence hall or Greek housing
options.
University Meal Plan

Nine meal plans are available. First year residents are required to
participate in the Category 1A Meal Plan or one of the Category I Meal
Plans. Upper-class students living in a traditional or suite-style residence
hall are required to participate in the Category 1A Meal Plan or one
of the Category I or II Meal Plans. Students residing in a fraternity or
sorority are expected to participate in their house meal plan but also
have the option to choose any of the university plans offered. Students
residing in campus apartments or any off-campus facilities are not
required to participate in a meal plan but have the option to choose any
of the plans offered.
Each meal plan includes Dining Dollars. This pre-paid declining balance
account was designed for maximum flexibility and convenience and can
be used at most dining locations on campus to further increase your
purchasing options.

Cost of Attendance
Tuition, Room, and Board charges are listed for the academic year (fall
and spring semesters) with one-half charged for each semester. Other
Fees are typically charged per occurrence.

The university reserves the right at any time to amend or add charges
and fees, as appropriate, to meet current requirements.
OTHER EXPENSES

A student should plan to meet various other expenses. These expenses
include the purchase of books and supplies from the Lehigh University
Bookstore located in Campus Square. Necessary purchases supporting
one’s academic program should average approximately $1,200 per year.
The Bookstore carries basic goods for students’ needs. A student should
also plan an allowance to handle personal and travel expenses.

Billing and Payments
Billing statements are available online for both the student and any
person the student authorizes. Semester billing statements are available
approximately six weeks prior to the start of each semester. Payments
are due as follows: Fall semester by the first business day of August,
Spring semester by the first business day of January, and all Summer
Sessions five days prior to the start of classes. If registration occurs
after bills are issued, payment is still due prior to the start of classes.
Accounts not settled by the due date are subject to a late payment fee.
Persons desiring a payment plan can elect participation in the
university’s educational payment plan which provides for the payment
of tuition, room, and board over four months per semester. Deadlines
st
st
to participate are July 1 for Fall Semester and December 1 for Spring
Semester.
The university also offers a plan under which enrolled undergraduate
students can pre-pay more than one year of tuition. Enrollment period
is through June to lock in the following academic year tuition rate.
Complete information is available from the Bursar’s Office.
Students attending the university under a provision with a state board
of assistance or with financial aid from other outside agencies must
provide complete information to the Bursar’s Office if assistance is to be
recognized to avoid late payment fees.

Refunds of Charges
TUITION AND ACADEMIC FEES

The tuition refund for a student who withdraws or drops a course(s)
is calculated on a daily basis. No refunds for tuition can be made for
courses or workshops with five class sessions or less after the first
day of class. Additional penalties may apply to withdraw from special
programs or courses held at off-campus locations, such as Study
Abroad or Geology Field Camp.
The date used to calculate refunds is based on when a properly
authorized withdrawal or drop/add is received by the Registrar’s Office.
Academic fees (such as Technology Fee, Engineering and Science Fee,
course associated fees, etc.) are generally non-refundable after the first
day of classes.
In the event of a medical withdrawal or death of a student, certified
by the Dean of Students, tuition will be refunded in proportion to the
semester remaining.
Tuition Credit/Refund for a Disciplinary Suspension or Expulsion

A student who is suspended from the University during the semester
in which the incident occurred is eligible for a tuition credit that will be
applied to the semester immediately following the period of suspension.
The amount of tuition credited will be based upon the tuition refund
schedule for a voluntary withdrawal and the tuition rate in effect during
the semester in which the incident occurred less any required financial
aid adjustments and any outstanding balance on the student’s account.
The date used to calculate the tuition credit will be the date of the
incident that resulted in the suspension. Tuition credit not utilized in the
semester immediately following the period of suspension is forfeited.
A student who is expelled from the University forfeits all payments for
tuition and fees incurred for the semester the incident occurred.
If the decision to suspend or expel a student is made in a semester
subsequent to the semester in which the incident occurred, the student
is eligible to receive a 100% tuition refund less any required financial aid
adjustments and less any other outstanding balance on the students’
account for any courses that the student is unable to complete as a
result of the suspension/expulsion. Refunds will not be distributed until
all disciplinary procedures including the appeals process are complete.
The University may, in its sole discretion, place a hold on the student’s
academic records at the time of the incident, which will limit access to
transcripts and other educational records until the disciplinary process is
complete.
Please note that financial aid is not guaranteed for students who exceed
8 semesters of enrollment because of a disciplinary suspension.
REFUND SPECIFICS

Credit balances resulting from an overpayment with a bank card are
eligible to be refunded as a credit transaction to the bank card by
contacting the Bursar’s Office.
Credit balances resulting from an overpayment with a check drawn on
a domestic bank require a minimum two week waiting period before a
refund check will be issued.
Credit balances resulting from loans, grants, scholarships, and other
th
forms of financial aid are eligible for refund after the 10 day of class.
All refund checks will be payable to the student unless
1. the student has authorized in writing a parent or guardian listed in
the Banner Student System to receive the refund, or
2. the check payment on the account was clear that the payment was
from an unrelated organization or institution, such as a sponsoring
corporation.

An undergraduate student in good standing who formally withdraws or
reduces his or her course enrollment below twelve credit hours before
60% of the semester has been completed during the fall and spring
semesters will be eligible for a tuition refund. An undergraduate student
in good standing who formally withdraws or reduces his or her course
enrollment before 60% of a session has been completed during the
summer sessions will be eligible for a tuition refund.

Refund checks are mailed to the student’s university post office address
or, if none, to the student’s “home address” listed in the Banner Student
System. Any exception to this policy must be authorized in writing by the
student.

A graduate student in good standing who formally withdraws or reduces
his or her course enrollment before 60% of the semester has been
completed during any semester will be eligible for a tuition refund.

RESIDENCE HALL/HOUSING REFUNDS

Students receiving financial aid that drop below full time status must
have their financial aid package re-evaluated by the Office of Financial
Aid prior to the issuance of any refund check.
Residence hall rooms are rented on an annual basis only. A student
who signs a housing contract is expected to reside in and be financially
responsible for residence hall housing for both the fall and spring

Lehigh University 2016-2017

semesters of the specific academic year for which the contract was
signed. A student who forfeits a housing reservation and who returns
to the university at any time during the contracted academic year is still
obligated for housing charges if vacancy in the residence hall facilities
exists and without regard to location.
Prior to registration, housing rental refunds are made in full in the event
a student does not register because of illness or injury; is dropped from
the university due to academic reasons; attends a university-approved
study abroad or co-op program; graduates; or voluntarily withdraws
from the university. After registration, prorated housing rental refunds
are granted for the same reasons. Prorated refunds are based upon
the date the room has been vacated, belongings are removed, and the
room key is returned to the Office of Residential Services. Any student
suspended or expelled from housing or the university will not be granted
any housing rental refund.
UNIVERSITY MEAL PLAN REFUNDS

Meal plan refunds are made in full in the event a student does not
register and has not purchased any meals from the plan.
After registration, a student who purchases meals on the plan but
withdraws from the university will receive a pro-rata meal plan refund
based on the date of the last use or number of meals remaining
depending on the meal plan chosen. The Dining Dollar portion is nonrefundable.
Any student suspended or expelled from housing or the university will
not be granted a meal plan refund.
Meal plans may be changed within the requirements of the living area up
to the tenth day of class each semester on line with charges assessed
per an established proration schedule.
After the tenth day of class, a student who wishes to change a meal plan
must petition and receive approval from the Office of Student Auxiliary
Services. If the change is approved, an adjustment will be processed on
a pro-rata basis to the meal portion of the plan charge as of the week
following the last meal purchased.
ADJUSTMENTS TO FINANCIAL AID

The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for determining the appropriate
redistribution of charges and refunds when students receive any
financial assistance. These decisions are made on the basis of federal,
state and institutional policies. Any refunds due to the Title IV programs
will be refunded in the following order:
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan
Federal Perkins Loan
Direct PLUS Loan
Federal Pell Grant
Federal SEOG
Any other Title IV program

Financial Aid
The mission of the Office of Financial Aid is to reduce the financial
barriers to a Lehigh education for those families whose resources alone
would make it impossible to meet the cost of attendance. The university
is deeply committed to providing need-based financial aid.
Lehigh expects each family to make every effort to pay tuition and other
educational expenses. Our aid program is designed to measure the
difference between our costs and the amount of money your family
can be expected to contribute towards those costs. That difference
is called “financial need” and represents financial aid “eligibility.” The
majority of Lehigh’s funds are awarded on the basis of financial need.
Students must file on time and meet academic progress requirements to
be eligible for consideration. Our merit-based aid program is explained
below.
The basic components of financial aid consist of gift aid (grants and
scholarships) and self help (employment and loan assistance). Gift aid
is generally not repayable. The majority are awarded on the basis of
“need” and are renewable on the basis of continuing “need”, satisfactory
academic progress criteria and on time filing. Employment provides
money for books and personal expenses, and is paid through biweekly
payroll checks based on hours worked. Loans are repayable funds from

11

one or more sources, repayable after the student ceases to be enrolled
on at least a halftime basis.
Additional sources of aid include, but are not limited to: state
agencies, employers, and various clubs, churches, religious and
fraternal organizations, and foundations. High school guidance
counselors are able to provide information about local aid programs.
There are also database scholarship search organizations that
can be accessed via the World Wide Web. Some examples are
www.fastweb.com (http://www.fastweb.com), www.collegeboard.com
(http://www.collegeboard.com), www.collegenet.com (http://
www.collegenet.com) and www.gocollege.com (http://
www.gocollege.com). (Caution: there are many scam operations that
promise great things if you send them a check. It is better to limit your
efforts to the proven sites referenced above. ) You are expected to take
maximum advantage of any outside financial assistance for which you
may qualify, including Federal Grant and state grant programs to enable
Lehigh to spread its own funds further and to limit student borrowing.
The financial aid office website carries complete information:

Application Procedures
APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR 2016-2017

Students who are applying for institutional need-based aid are required
to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA –
online www.fafsa.ed.gov (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov)), the College
Scholarship Service CSS PROFILE (online www.collegeboard.com
(http://www.collegeboard.com)), Federal tax forms (student, parent and
business tax returns if applicable) and non-custodial parent application
(CSS Profile and Federal tax forms), if applicable. For more detailed
information such as deadlines and links to forms, please visit the
financial aid website at www.lehigh.edu/financialaid.
INTERNATIONAL CANDIDATES

International students may be eligible for university-funded financial
aid. Opportunities are limited. Two forms are required: the International
Student Financial Aid Application and the Certificate of Finances. The
forms can be found on the Admissions website under “Applying to
Lehigh.” Students who do not receive financial aid as a first year student
are not eligible for aid in future semesters.
RENEWAL OF AID

Financial need is reviewed annually to ensure aid eligibility as
determined by the Office of Financial Aid, in conjunction with federal,
state and university guidelines, reflects current financial and household
information. In order to maintain federal and institutional grant eligibility
from one academic year to the next, students must continue to
demonstrate financial need. Changes in circumstances such as
sibling(s) enrollment in undergraduate college, changes in household
size or changes in income may result in a change in financial aid
eligibility. Completed renewal applications are due to our office by April
15 of each year.
All students receiving financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic
progress. Satisfactory academic progress for Federal financial aid
eligibility differs from the academic progress policy for institutional aid.
To maintain eligibility for Federal aid, students are expected to maintain
satisfactory academic progress based on both qualitative (cumulative
GPA) and quantitative standards (pace of progression). Students must
achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of a 1.70 after their freshman year
(earning between 0 and 22 credits) and a minimum cumulative GPA
of 2.0 for all other grade levels (23 credits and above). Per Federal
Guidelines, students have a maximum of 12 semesters of Federal Aid
to complete their graduate requirements (aggregate loan limits apply as
well). Students must successfully complete a minimum of 67% of their
attempted coursework.
In order to maintain eligibility for Institutional financial aid, students
must 1.) Earn 12 new credits each semester, 2.) Earn a minimum grade
point average of 2.0 for each semester, and 3.) Maintain a minimum
cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Eligibility for institutional aid
at Lehigh University is limited to 8 consecutive semesters (unless
you are enrolled in a bona-fide 5-year program such as IBE or Art
Engineering). NOTE: Institutional aid is provided to assist students in
obtaining a bachelor’s degree. Additional aid will not be available to

12

students who choose to enhance their bachelor’s degree with additional
credentials (ie. second major/minors) and are unable to do so during the
8 consecutive semesters.
For both Federal and Institutional aid purposes, academic progress
will be checked annually, at the end of each payment period, unless a
student is on Financial Aid Probation, in which case SAP will be checked
at the end of each semester.

Sources of University Aid
Several forms of university-funded aid, based on need and merit, are
available.
LEHIGH UNIVERSITY GRANTS [ENDOWED AND SPONSORED
SCHOLARSHIPS]

Lehigh Grants are need-based awards funded through university funds
and endowments established by generous alumni and friends of the
university. The general Lehigh Grant fund is originally awarded to act as
a “placeholder” until we are notified of the amounts we are able to award
for each of the named scholarship funds. The general Lehigh Grant
may be swapped with an endowed or sponsored Lehigh scholarship,
established by a donor.
LEHIGH UNIVERSITY MERIT SCHOLARSHIPS

Merit-based awards are gift aid awarded to students solely on a
merit basis. When awarding merit aid, we take a holistic approach,
looking beyond the numbers related to academic talent alone and
reviewing what a student contributes outside the classroom as well
as considering recommendations and personal essays. Selection
for Lehigh merit-scholarship recipients is made by the Admissions
Office -- all students are considered for these awards during review of
admission applications. Merit awards can be given in the amounts of
full-tuition (Founders Scholarship), half-tuition (Trustees Scholarship)
and $12,000 (Deans Scholarship). Awards are renewable for four years
of undergraduate study and require a 3.0 average and satisfactory
progress toward a Lehigh degree.
CUTLER-SAMETZ CHORAL ARTS SCHOLARSHIPS

Several merit scholarships of $5,000 are available for gifted students
in the Choral Arts who maintain at least a 2.8 grade point average.
Talented singers are eligible for these scholarships, renewable for four
years, and recipients also receive free vocal lessons. Scholars are
expected to join the University Choir. A separate application from the
music department is required.
SNYDER FAMILY MARCHING SCHOLARSHIPS

Established by alumnus Joseph Snyder and family, these scholarships
are for students who demonstrate musical talent and leadership
skills. The scholarship provides awards of $1,500. Recipients of this
scholarship agree to participate fully in the Marching Band. Recipients
must maintain at least a 2.8 grade point average. A separate application
is required
PERFORMING ARTS SCHOLARSHIPS

Open to students in any academic major or program, these scholarships
recognize students with exceptional musical and theatrical (including
performance, design, technical, and playwriting) talent. These
scholarships are valued at $5,000 and are renewable for four years.
Recipients must maintain at least a 2.8 grade point average and
remain active in the performing arts at Lehigh. A separate application is
required.
ARMY ROTC LEADERSHIP AWARDS

In certain instances, the university may supplement an Army ROTC
scholarship with a leadership award that is equal to the cost of room
and board. These are highly competitive and require a 2.5 average for
renewal.
NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLARSHIP CORPORATION AWARDS

Lehigh is a collegiate sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship program.
Scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 per year may be awarded to
Merit finalists selecting Lehigh as their first choice college, and who are
not also receiving another form of National Merit scholarship.
ATHLETIC AWARDS

Athletics scholarships are available for students with exceptional athletic
ability.

PRESIDENT’S SCHOLARS PROGRAM

This scholarship recognizes outstanding academic achievement by
undergraduate students by providing a fifth year (i.e., a 9th and 10th
semester) of study free of tuition. This benefit is intended to give
students an opportunity to (1) pursue a second undergraduate degree,
(2) pursue a graduate degree, or (3) undertake an advanced project
of a scholarly or creative nature (e.g., a thesis, a portfolio of artwork, a
design project, a field or laboratory research project) that does not lead
to a degree. For more information and to learn about other restrictions
please visit the Registrar's website (http://www.lehigh.edu/registrar/
students/pres_scholar.html).

Availability of Jobs
Work-study jobs are available throughout the university and are funded
through federal and university sources. If you are offered work-study as
part of your aid package, the Office of Financial Aid maintains a listing
of available on-campus jobs. Pay rates range from the federal minimum
wage to $10.00 per hour. You are paid on a bi-weekly basis, as you
work and submit timesheets. Your work-study earnings are not deducted
from your billed expenses.
The Job Locator Development Program is designed to assist you
if you do not qualify under the Federal Work-Study program to find
employment off-campus or with a number of incubator companies
located on the Mountaintop Campus. This program is coordinated
through the Office of Career Services.

Aid from the Government
Lehigh University is an eligible participant in federally funded student aid
programs. Campus-based programs, where the university makes the
awards based on the dollars available, include:
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants
Federal Perkins Loans
Federal Work Study
Direct entitlement programs (where the government directly, or through
commercial lenders for loan programs, provides the necessary funds)
include:
Federal Pell Grants
Federal Direct Subsidized Loans
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans
Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)
Please visit our website at www.lehigh.edu/financialaid for more detailed
information on any of these programs.

Information for All Financial Aid Applicants
The Office of Financial Aid determines your financial aid award based
solely on your family’s demonstrated financial need. We consider
many factors, such as your family’s income, assets, size and unusual
expenses, and our program is designed to help families across
the economic spectrum. Please note the following important items
regarding the need-based financial aid process:
• Family Responsibility: Lehigh’s philosophy behind financial
aid eligibility is that a student and his or her parents are first and
foremost responsible for the expenses related to obtaining an
undergraduate degree. Furthermore, our expectation is that both
parents, regardless of marital status, have a responsibility to
participate in the financial aid process.
• Expected Family Contribution: Lehigh financial aid counselors
carefully review the information your family provides in the financial
aid application, including any additional circumstances brought to
our attention, in order to determine the Expected Family Contribution
(http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary), also known as the
“EFC." It is important to understand that the Expected Family
Contribution is not what we think a family has “left over” after other
expenses have been covered, and we do not necessarily expect that
the parent contribution will be paid from current income. Rather,
the level of contribution reflects our analysis of what parents can
afford to absorb in education costs over time. Parents may choose
to provide their contribution from savings, current income, future
income (through borrowing), or some combination.

Lehigh University 2016-2017

• Determining Need-Based Financial Aid Eligibility: Need-based
eligibility is calculated per academic year and is determined using
the following formula:
Cost of attendance for one academic year - calculated EFC =
financial need
• Merit-Based Financial Aid: All students are considered for merit
aid at the time of admission. Students who are selected to receive
a merit-based scholarship will be notified when they are admitted
to the University. The Office of Financial Aid does not determine
eligibility for merit scholarships (academic, athletic or otherwise),
and the application process described on our website is not
related to these resources. View more information on Lehigh merit
scholarships > (http://www1.lehigh.edu/admissions/undergrad/tuition)
If a student has demonstrated financial need (http://www1.lehigh.edu/
financialaid/glossary), this financial need will be covered with a
combination of gift-aid (http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary) and
self-help (http://www1.lehigh.edu/financialaid/glossary).

Club Sports

SYMPHONIC BAND

The Symphonic Band meets and performs only in the spring semester of
each year. The ensemble consists of students, faculty and staff who are
interested in playing music. No audition is necessary.
WIND ENSEMBLE

The Wind Ensemble, under the direction of David B. Diggs, is a select
group of students dedicated to performing music for woodwinds, brass
and percussion. These students represent many diverse majors. In 1999
the Wind Ensemble was honored by Downbeat Magazine, receiving the
award for the most outstanding college classical symphonic band.
LEHIGH UNIVERSITY CHORAL ARTS

The Lehigh University Choral Arts, directed by Steven Sametz, is the
umbrella organization for a number of vocal ensembles:
LEHIGH UNIVERSITY CHOIR

The Choir is an active force in campus life. The 60 mixed voices of
the Choir, drawn from all majors of the University, are auditioned at
the beginning of the academic year. They give four major concerts on
campus and tour internationally. The Choir frequently performs with
orchestra and regularly performs new music, including many works
written especially for them. They have been heard five times on National
Public Radio. The Choir has toured to Austria, China, France, Germany,
Korea, Portugal, Russia, Thailand, Taiwan, and has performed in
Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall at New York’s Lincoln Center.
LEHIGH UNIVERSITY CHORAL UNION

The Lehigh University Choral Union, composed of students, faculty,
staff, and Lehigh Valley community members performs three times a
year with internationally known soloists and a full symphony orchestra.
The 200 singers of the Choral Union bring major works such as
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, Mahler’s Second Symphony, and the
Brahms Requiem to a broad audience. No audition is required.
LEHIGH UNIVERSITY GLEE CLUB

The recently revived Glee Club sings traditional and new music for male
voices under the direction of Steven Sametz. Enthusiastically welcomed
by alumni and the university community, the Glee Club has thrilled
audiences on campus, on tour in China, and at Lincoln Center, where
they performed with the University Choir.
DOLCE

Dolce – Lehigh University’s Women’s Ensemble under the direction of
Sun Min Lee begins a new tradition of women’s music on campus. They
perform on campus and in the community. This group sings a variety of
music written especially for female voices as well as music adapted for
the group. Members of Dolce also sing with the University Choir.

Club Sports
A Club Sport is formed when a group of students voluntarily organize in
the aim of seeking structured and often competitive sport opportunities
in an area of common interest. Club sports are structured and guided
by the principles and obligations of other student organizations, and are
not formally recognized until they are fully compliant and meet required
expectations. The initiative, organizational commitment and personal
investment required for club sports participation fosters an extraordinary
learning and leadership experience.
Competition can range from a club varsity status such as Men’s Ice
Hockey and Men’s Rowing to competitive sports such as Cycling,
Equestrian, Men’s and Women’s Rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, Water Polo or
non competitive sports that includes Badminton and Gymnastics just to
name a few. In total, there are 32 recognized club sports that are active.

Intramural Sports
Intramural sports are organized, structured, and competitive activities
that are played within the University. At Lehigh, members form teams
from IFC, Pan-Hellenic, off campus houses and dorms. These teams
and individuals accumulate trophy points in sporting contests for an
overall All University Champion in one of four divisions: Upper-class
Greek, Upper-class Independent, Women and Freshmen. Intramural
sports, which varies from 11 to 15 activities, offers our students a
high degree of physical fitness, helps establish habits of regular and

healthful exercise, fosters the development of self confidence, good
sportsmanship, and a spirit of cooperation.

Fitness
The Fitness Programming initiatives at Lehigh exist to promote the
development of a physically educated person. Opportunities are
provided for all members of the Lehigh community to learn skills
necessary to perform a variety of physical activities and acknowledge
the implications of and the benefits from involvement in physical
activities. We teach the value of physical activity and its contribution
to a healthful lifestyle. Our programs focus on activities in which a
person can participate over the course of a lifetime, and contribute to the
development of health-related components of physical fitness through
sport.

Recreation
The entire Lehigh community is invited to participate in the annual
Turkey Trot, compete in organized leagues such as summer softball
and others during the academic year or informal activities such as lap
swimming in our pool, playing pickup basketball, refining your dance
moves in the Dance Studio which are all located in Taylor Gym. The
Goodman Campus provides a vast green space, to throw a Frisbee, kick
a soccer ball or play a friendly game of touch football.
You can run on our nationally known cross country course, hit a tennis
ball at the Lewis Tennis Center or drive a bucket of golf balls at the
Mulvihill Golf Learning Center. The opportunities are endless!

Student Code of Conduct
Intellectual honesty and mutual respect are not accidental values in a
university. They are, for students and professors alike, a presupposition
of the pursuit of truth, which brings universities into existence. It is
essential that an academic community uphold these values. The student
code of conduct and the student conduct system are mechanisms by
which the university endeavors to develop in all students a sense of
responsibility to the Lehigh University community.
The Lehigh University Student handbook (http://
studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/handbook) contains information relevant
for the student members of our community. All students have an
obligation to read and be familiar with the Student Handbook, the Code
of Conduct, and the other policies contained therein.

In Bethlehem, An Educational Tradition
Lehigh University shares in the historical heritage of Bethlehem, even
though, having been founded in 1865, it is a relative newcomer. The
fact that Lehigh was established in Bethlehem reflects the tradition of
education established by the community’s first settlers thirty years before
the founding of the nation.
The first Moravians were among the many German religious sects that
came to the New World, and especially to Pennsylvania, during the
early 1700s. But unlike William Penn, who established his sylvania as a
new land where he might hold his Quaker beliefs away from England’s
oppression, the Moravians came as missionaries with the intent of
converting the Indians to Christianity. For this purpose they settled the
Lehigh Valley.
The early Moravians were industrious. Their first building, the Gemein
Haus (community house) was completed in 1741. This building stands
today, one of thirty-nine remarkably preserved pre-Revolutionary War
buildings constructed by the Moravian settlers and in continuous use
ever since by the Moravian community. Many of these buildings are
located on Church St., west of the City Center; industrial buildings are
located in the 18th Century Industrial Area in the Monocacy Creek valley
west of the business district.
The leader of the Moravians was Count Nicholas von Zinzendorf of
Dresden. He arrived in the settlement in time for their observance of
Christmas Eve in 1741 and gave the settlement the name Bethlehem
—“house of bread”.
The settlers built high-quality structures of stone, demonstrating
principles of engineering that were not generally used elsewhere. They
were interested in music, and established the first symphony orchestra

Lehigh University 2016-2017

in America. In 1748, the settlement had a fourteen-man orchestra. The
community’s first organ was built in 1757 by John Gottlob Klemm. The
musical tradition, including the trombone choir, continues today, perhaps
most visibly in the Bach Choir of Bethlehem, whose yearly Bach Festival
is held in the university’s Packer Memorial Church. In 1985, the 300th
anniversary of the birth of Johann Sebastian Bach was observed.
Zinzendorf envisioned Bethlehem as the center for manufacturing;
outlying Moravian settlements, such as Nazareth, Pa., would be
primarily devoted to agriculture. On October 15, 1742, a large barn was
“raised” with the help of most of the residents. Three months later a grist
mill at the community spring produced the first flour. In 1758, the Sun
Inn was built along Main St., a haven for travelers. Reconstruction of
the picturesque inn was completed in 1982, and it now operates as a
community center and restaurant.
Zinzendorf’s determination that Bethlehem would be a major industrial
center was assisted by the completion in 1755 of the water works, the
first public utility in the New World.
The Moravian dedication to education was an extension of the
philosophy of John Amos Comenius, who had written, “Everyone ought
to receive a universal education.” The Moravian educational institutions
that continue today, including Moravian Academy and Moravian College,
stem from this tradition.
The Moravians, although avowedly opposed to war, found their
community pressed into service as a hospital when Washington’s troops
bivouacked at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777-78. Washington
came to the community once, and many other Continental Army officers
were visitors.
The Sun Inn was also used as a hospital during the war; among its
patients was an aristocratic renegade from France, Marie Joseph Paul
Ives Gilbert Motier, the Marquis de la Fayette. Lafayette had come to
assist the Continental Army aboard his own ship, the “Victory.” Fifty
years later a college in Easton was named in his honor and it became
Lehigh’s traditional football rival.
The first bridge across the Lehigh River was built in 1794. It was
replaced in 1816, but the latter was destroyed by a flood in 1841. In
1759, the turnpike (toll road) over South Mountain, generally along the
route of the present Wyandotte St. hill, was opened. The present Hill-toHill Bridge was built some fifty years ago.
“Black gold.” During the late 18th century, anthracite was found in
the mountains north of the Lehigh Valley. In 1818, the Lehigh Coal
Co. and the Lehigh Navigation Co. were formed, one to mine the
anthracite on the upper Lehigh River, the other to transport it down river
to metropolitan markets.
The Lehigh River was difficult to navigate. Consequently, in 1829 the
Lehigh Canal was completed from Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe),
through Bethlehem to Easton, where it connected with the Delaware
Canal. During the 1840s, iron mines were opened in the area, and
several blast furnaces, fueled by coal, were in operation. Zinc ore, was
found in neighboring Upper Saucon Township. In the 1850s Asa Packer
built the Lehigh Valley Railroad. These origins eventually led to the
heavy industry that continues in the Lehigh Valley today.
When Asa Packer founded Lehigh University in 1865, one of his
objectives was to make possible broadly based education for young
people of the region, combining the technical skills needed to run the
flourishing industry of the Lehigh Valley with a liberal education.
In addition to its role as a steel-making center, Bethlehem today is a
major tourist attraction. The Moravian community sets up an elaborate
nativity scene and the entire city is decorated with lighting during the
holiday period. The Moravian tradition of a single candle (now electric) in
each window is widely observed.
Atop South Mountain is a steel tower known as the Star of Bethlehem.
During the holiday period, the star’s hundreds of bulbs create a 95-foothigh star that can be seen for many miles. The star was the gift to the
community of Marion Brown Grace, wife of Eugene Gifford Grace, the
steel magnate and president of the university board of trustees.
The community of Bethlehem has a population of approximately 78,000
persons with segments from a variety of nations who retain traditions of
their country of origin.

15

There are five principal independent colleges in the Lehigh Valley
besides Lehigh. They are Lafayette, DeSales University, Moravian,
Muhlenberg, and Cedar Crest. A cooperative program is maintained that
allows cross-registration for courses as well as shared cultural events.
There are also two community colleges in the area.
In August 1984, Bethlehem held its first Musikfest, a 10-day annual
festival that features a variety of musical performances and ethnic foods.
An instant success, Musikfest was the brainchild of Jeffrey A. Parks, a
lawyer and 1970 Lehigh graduate.

University Resources

University Resources
Lehigh University offers a variety of resources to support the campus
community.

Library and Technology Services
The exponential growth and increasing sophistication of information
technology offer new and exciting opportunities for enhanced teaching,
learning, and research. At Lehigh University, one merged organization
called Library and Technology Services (LTS) delivers communications,
computing, distance education administration, enterprise systems
implementation, faculty development, library, and media services to
capitalize on these new opportunities. Additional information about
Library and Technology Services can be found at www.lehigh.edu/lts.

Lehigh also provides secure wireless connectivity in many campus
settings – see http://lts.lehigh.edu/services/faq/wireless-networking-faq.
Through Lehigh’s enterprise systems, convenient interactive services
such as online course registration and online grades are offered to
students. There is also a parent portal configured to parent’s needs
and interests. Library and Technology Services supports a telephone
system.

Computing

Libraries

Providing technology and consulting services to support classroom
teaching, laboratories, and other aspects of the academic and research
programs is a strategic priority for Lehigh University. About 600
Windows and Macintosh personal computers are distributed across
campus for convenient use by students at more than 27 computing sites.

Lehigh University has two major library facilities, the Linderman
Library and the Fairchild-Martindale Library. The Lehigh University
library collection comprises over one million volumes. Subscriptions to
periodicals are mostly in electronic format, and the collection of ebooks
is growing at a rapid rate.

Students and faculty have access to site-licensed software applications
and central file storage from on and off campus. LTS provides
software at public sites for general word processing and spreadsheets,
mathematical and statistical packages, and specialized applications for
scientific and engineering work.

The historic Linderman Library reopened after an extensive renovation
as a showcase for humanities programs and collections, as well as
an intellectual center for the campus at large. The 1878 high Victorian
rotunda and the 1929 grand reading room were retained in all their
magnificence. Among the new features are: seminar rooms, a computer
classroom, exhibition space, group studies, a cafe, and wireless
throughout. Linderman houses books and journals in the humanities
and Lehigh’s impressive collection of rare books including Darwin’s
Origin of Species and John James Audubon’s four-volume elephant
folio edition of Birds of America. Digital library projects highlight various
th
aspects of the collection from “Digital Bridges” (books on 19 century
bridge construction) and “Beyond Steel” (materials examining the social
and cultural impact of the Lehigh Valley’s industrial past) to the Brown
and White student newspaper archive. In addition, Special Collections
holds numerous archival collections that focus on industrial and regional
history.

Lehigh provides access to a variety of computing systems suitable
for large scale computation and compute-intensive applications.
These systems contain over 2000 processing cores and over 4
terabytes of memory available to tackle the most complex and
demanding research projects. For more information, see http://
researchcomputing.lehigh.edu/. University computing capacity and
Internet bandwidth are continuously being increased to meet escalating
demand,

The Fairchild-Martindale Library contains electronic and print books
and journals in all branches of science, engineering, mathematics,
and the social sciences, including business and education. It provides
collaborative learning spaces, wireless connectivity, a small cafe, and
comfortable lounge areas.

Instructional Media Services

The Libraries offer students, faculty, and staff a full range of electronic
journals, full text and image databases easily accessible from on and off
campus. The library web page library.lehigh.edu serves as a gateway
to these resources, as well as encompassing news items, a blog, library
hours, and an invaluable set of library research guides (Libguides). The
web page also provides quick access to most library services and to
research assistance. Interlibrary loan via ILLiad or PALCI (Pennsylvania
academic libraries) allows for rapid and easy borrowing from collections
in other libraries. There is also desktop delivery of scanned articles
in Lehigh’s print journal collection. Students and faculty may also
borrow books directly from other academic libraries in the Lehigh Valley
Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC).

Networking and Voice Communications
Lehigh University is a “wired” campus in every sense of the word. A
highspeed fiber optic backbone network ties together campus buildings
and student residences, including fraternities and sororities. The
Campus Portal allows each member of the Lehigh community to fully
customize their access to web-based information and applications.
Student computer use in the residences is supported by the WIRED
program. Staff communicate with students in advance of their arrival
at Lehigh to identify for them compatible hardware and software for
use on the campus network. When students bring their computers to
campus, staff assist them with their initial setup and provide continuing
assistance with any networking problems throughout the semester. The
front line WIRED consultants are well-trained students who live in the
residences and can readily provide prompt, onsite assistance. See http://
lts.lehigh.edu/services/wired.

The Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning supports faculty
innovation -- see the Faculty Development section of this catalog for
details. Library and Technology Services provides technical support
for the many computer classrooms, suitable for individual “handson” instruction. 85% of all Lehigh University classrooms are equipped
with permanently-installed computer projection systems. Equipment is
available through the Digital Media Studio to enable faculty or students
to give computer-based presentations in any space.

Library and Technology Services offers an extensive media collection
and streaming video services for courses. Videos and DVDs and
available for viewing (all users) and for shot-term loan (faculty and
graduate students) from Fairchild-Martindale Library Lending Services.
The Digital Media Studio offers students and faculty consulting
assistance, a video editing lab, and a wide range of technology to
support the creation of professional audio, graphic, and video materials
for classroom presentations, projects, and portfolios. Students can scan
and edit text, and these images can be output to printers or to computer
files for further manipulation. Digital still and video cameras, a video
and photography studio, and editing software facilitate the production
of audio and video material to support the academic program. Loaner
projectors, laptops and audio recorders are also available.
A third media facility, the International Multimedia Resource Center
(IMRC), is located in nearby Maginnes Hall.

Student Services
The library, computing center, and most distributed computing facilities
are open seven days per week and for evening hours during the fall and
spring semesters. During final exams the Fairchild-Martindale Library
is open 24 hours. For most of these hours, a help desk located at the
Fairchild-Martindale Library provides general help for students and
faculty onsite and for telephone inquiries relating to both library research
and computing. Help desk staff refer more specialized questions to
experts as needed.
Students may also take advantage of virtual help desks where they
enter the questions or problems relating to library research, computing
hardware or software, or telecommunications at any hour of the day or
night for response at a later time, usually within one working day. Most
library and computing services are available electronically, for example,

Lehigh University 2016-2017

interlibrary loan and seminar registrations. “Live chat” library reference
and computing help services are also available during many hours.
Each semester Library and Technology Services offers an extensive
program of seminars and course-based instructional sessions for
students. Attendees learn how to use software applications, library
resources, and the Web-authoring tools. LTS professionals work closely
with faculty to integrate library, computing and media resources into
the curriculum. They facilitate the use of course management software,
online courses of various kinds, and course projects in a wide range of
disciplines using interactive Web sites created by faculty and students.
Through seminars and policies on the use of print and electronic
resources, students are taught computer ethics, recommended
computing practices such as frequent backup and password changes,
and an understanding and respect for state and federal laws governing
copyright, privacy, and destruction or vandalism of library resources or
computer systems, networks, databases or software. A free electronic
newsletter, LTS Digest, with quick tips and updates is published
throughout the year and is available to students who subscribe. There is
also a newsletter, the LTS Connection.
Library and Technology Services maintains a variety of facilities for
printing, scanning, copying, and duplicating within the constraints of
copyright and yearly paper consumption restrictions. In the Libraries
are public scanners, and microform printers. The Digital Media Studio
can duplicate audio and video resources. There are printers at most
computing sites. Students are strongly encouraged to print responsibly
by using the duplex feature, never printing multiple copies, and
examining documents to eliminate unneeded sections before printing.

Student Employment
Student assistants are essential for the operation of most Library
and Technology Services functions. Working for LTS, graduate and
undergraduate students gain valuable skills and good work habits. At the
job fair, held each fall, there are opportunities to learn in-depth about the
jobs available.

Lehigh University Art Galleries – Museum Operation
(LUAG)
Lehigh University Art Galleries – Museum Operation’s (LUAG)
central educational resource is viewed as a multifaceted integrated
classroom in which education is approached in the following ways:
Museum and Curatorial Studies; Collections Care and Management;
Exhibitions and Interpretation; and Partnership with the Community.
Courses are taught across-the-disciplines using the University’s worldclass teaching collection, which represents a diverse and broad crosssection of art and culture. Students and faculty are engaged in direct
experiential learning within the Integrated Teaching Collection and
Visual Laboratory. Exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, and videos in
eight campus locations are planned specifically to function as teaching
tools for exploring diverse topics in visual literacy and the humanities.
Museum Education and Community Engagement
As a university museum, LUAG is a well-established, evolutionary
and progressive program within the broader institutional mandate of
Lehigh University. Our educational and cultural mission is advanced
through firsthand observation and hands-on training. Faculty from all
disciplines is encouraged to seek opportunities for teaching through
our Collection. Students develop skills to respond critically to a rapidly
changing world through problem-based learning and collaboration,
ultimately preparing them to become well-informed consumers of visual
culture in the broadest sense. We create educational opportunities
for the entire student body, and enrich the cultural life of the campus
and the community at large. LUAG works in conjunction with Art|
Architecture|Design, History, and Curatorial and Museum Studies, as
well as other departments on campus to increase involvement in the arts
and humanities.
During the past few years, we have expanded our Gallery activities
to include more docent-guided tours, greater volunteer engagement,
and special programs. One of our current initiatives is to create an
atmosphere of “accessible art” for visitors with vision loss or limited
vision. With the assistance of internal and external writers, we provide
audio descriptions and tactile diagrams of select artwork in the Teaching

17

Collection. The descriptions will enable visitors the ability to “see” with
their mind’s eye, encouraging a more relaxed and accessible viewing of
the collection for all visitors.
University museums invite exploration and the traversing of boundaries,

They represent students of undergraduate and graduate institutions, and
managers from global corporations and family-owned businesses.
Global Village on the Move was established through a growing interest
among our partner institutions to deliver the Global Village in their own
countries, regions and territories. While GV is not a mobile program,
the Iacocca Institute determined that shorter seven-to-ten day versions
could be delivered in collaboration with existing recruitment partners
outside of North America. Qualified partners will have visited and
provided attendees to the GV flagship program. The opportunity
to provide a collaborative immersion learning experience, cultural
experience, and similar curriculum pattern in other countries has
allowed us to work with partners in Peru 2000, Spain 2003, Australia
2005, United Arab Emirates 2006, Malaysia 2010, Peru 2011, Italy
2012, China 2013, Russia 2014, and India 2015. Future programs are
scheduled for Luxembourg 2016, Croatia 2017, and Puerto Rico in 2018.
The Iacocca Institute fulfills its mission for leadership development of the
next generation in the Pennsylvania School for Global Entrepreneurship
(PSGE). PSGE is designed as a unique learning program to educate
top high school students from the U.S. and around the world on global
entrepreneurship. The four-week residential program focuses on
challenging students as they develop greater cultural awareness,
leadership skills, and learn business practices with other students,
faculty, and entrepreneurs. To date, PSGE has trained over 1009
students from 62 countries and 18 states.
The Iacocca Institute was established in 1987 with the support of
Lee A. Iacocca, former chairman and chief executive officer, Chrysler
Corporation, and a member of Lehigh’s Class of 1945.

Over the years, Lehigh University has developed an impressive ability to
forge university-industry-government partnerships. These partnerships
are critical not only to the future of universities but, also to improve U.S.
competitiveness. It is primarily through partnerships — with companies,
schools, government agencies and other universities — that the Iacocca
Institute pursues its mission of preparing current and future leaders for
a globally competitive marketplace. One of these partnering activities is
the Global Village for Future Leaders of Business and Industry® (GV).
The Global Village provides young adults from around the world the
chance to experience a total-immersion leadership program. Its purpose
is to provide personal and organizational change needed to thrive in
the emerging global economy. During the GV program, participants
who share the dream of a leadership career in business and industry
focus on developing knowledge of business and industry, enhancing
leadership and entrepreneurial skills, and establishing a powerful global
network. To date, more than 1941 interns representing 134 countries
have graduated from the program and are now part of the growing list
of GV alumni. GV participants are diverse in culture and background.

The Fulbright Program Office serves as a facilitator between the various
Fulbright offices nationwide and the Lehigh faculty and graduate
coordinators. In this capacity, the Office regularly publicizes scholarship
opportunities for faculty seeking to research or lecture overseas.
Conversely, the Office notifies Lehigh faculty of opportunities to host
Fulbright Outreach Lecturers or Scholars in Residence on campus.
The Office also works directly with the Fulbright Placement Officers,
encouraging them to send Fulbright student applications to Lehigh for
consideration. Once admitted, the Office provides Fulbright students,
as well as Fulbright Scholars coming to Lehigh, with orientation and
assimilation programs, local familiarization tours, and coordinates the
Fulbright Association on campus.

Lehigh University recommends international study. We support
programs that offer rigorous academic environments, immersion in host

perspectives on global economic, social, and political issues, seeing
the theoretical come to life in a real-world context, learning a new
language, engaging with people and cultures different from their own,
developing valuable career skills, and earning academic credit toward
a Lehigh degree. Many students find that study abroad is a catalyst for
intellectual and personal growth.
The Study Abroad Office conducts extensive advising activities, guiding
students through the process of identifying programs that fit personal
and academic goals; group and individual advising sessions take place
regularly. Study Abroad options exist for all majors and can take place
Freshman through Senior year. Students should start discussing study
abroad options with their academic advisor and the Study Abroad Office
as early as Freshman year.

Undergraduate Studies
A listing of undergraduate and graduate courses offered by Lehigh
University can be found in the Courses, Programs, and Curricula section
(p. 53), under each departmental heading. For purposes of record, all
approved courses are listed. It must be understood, however, that the
offerings in any given semester are contingent upon a number of factors,
including student needs as determined at the time of registration.
CREDIT HOURS

Each course is designated a credit value of the course in terms of
semester hours (“credit hours”).
COURSE NUMBERING

The course numbering system specifies which courses can be
applied to the program of study as the student progresses toward the
undergraduate or graduate degree. In general, the numbering series is
as follows:
• 0-99. Courses primarily for freshmen or sophomores. Not available
for graduate credit.
• 100-199. Intermediate-level undergraduate courses. Not open to
freshmen except on petition. Not available for graduate credit.
• 200-299. Advanced undergraduate courses. Courses in the College
of Business and Economics and specific departments as noted in the
listings are open to freshmen and sophomores only on petition. Not
available for graduate credit in the major field.
• 300-399. Advanced undergraduate courses. Same as 200-299, but
available for graduate credit in major field.
• 400-499. Graduate-level courses, open to undergraduates only by
petition.
PROVISIONAL COURSES

Each instructional department is authorized to offer provisional courses,
or those offered on a trial basis, as well as special opportunities courses.
Such courses can become a permanent part of the university curriculum.
These courses are numbered, as is appropriate, 95-98 . . . 195-198, . . .
295-298, . . . 395-398, for a maximum of two years.
PREREQUISITES

Academic preparation required for admission to courses is indicated
under “prerequisites” included at the end of each course description.
Prerequisites are stated in most cases for purposes of convenience in
terms of Lehigh courses. Academic status required for admission, where
numbering does not fully describe this status, is also indicated under
“prerequisites.”
A student who does not have the status (e.g., sophomore standing) or
the academic preparation set forth as prerequisites may request special
consideration. A student may either obtain online permission from the
designated college or department officer. Academic work completed
elsewhere must be attested in this manner as being substantially
equivalent to prerequisites listed. Each student is responsible to make
sure they meet and maintain all conditions of prerequisite for their
coursework prior to the start of classes. If a student fails to meet a
prerequisite after registration for a given course, the college deans
office, registrars office, and/or the instructor may take action to drop the
student from a course with unmet prerequisites.
In a few cases, co-requisites are indicated. In such instances the corequisite course is taken in the same semester.
INFORMATION LIMITS

The course descriptions are intended to guide the student in selecting
appropriate courses. For reasons of space, descriptions are brief. In
most cases, courses will have a significantly broader scope than the
topics listed in the description. In some courses, material may change
from what is described. If there is doubt concerning the appropriateness
of any course for the individual’s educational objectives, it is suggested
that the student confer with the adviser.
ABBREVIATIONS

Whenever possible, course listings contain information indicating what
requirements the course satisfies, the semester or semesters in which it
is offered, and the name of the scheduled instructor or instructors.

While all information herein is subject to change, the information is
included to serve as a guide in the selection of appropriate courses that
best fulfill the student’s academic requirements and personal goals.
The symbols following course descriptions for some College of Arts and
Sciences courses include:
GC. Courses that meet the Global Citizenship program requirements.
HU. Courses that meet the Humanities distribution requirements.
NS. Courses that meet the Science distribution requirements.
SS. Courses that meet the Social Science distribution requirements.
MA. Courses that meet the Mathematical distribution requirements.
ND. Not designated to meet distribution requirements.
The symbols following course descriptions for some College of
Engineering and Applied Science courses include:
ES. This code plus the following number indicates that the course
satisfies a number of hours of engineering science requirements for
ABET accreditation.

Graduation Requirements
Students are expected to maintain regular progress toward the
baccalaureate degree by carrying the “normal” course load—between
12 and 18 credit hours each semester. Each student is expected to
complete the baccalaureate degree by attending four consecutive
years and eight semesters. They may, however, wish to accelerate
the pace toward graduation by using advanced placement credits,
summer session study, and receiving credit for courses through
examination. Students will have a limit of 8 calendar years to complete
the requirements for the bachelor’s degree. Students may petition the
Committee on Standing of Students (SOS) for up to a one-year leave of
absence for special circumstances beyond their control.
Students in good academic standing earn their degrees by meeting
the requirements of their specific degree curriculum as well as general
university requirements. Students are expected to satisfy the credit-hour
requirements of their chosen curricula. Students should confer with their
advisors on matters related to curriculum.
Basic military science credit hours are in addition to the credit hours
specified in the curricula. A maximum of six credit hours of advanced
military science courses may be applied toward the baccalaureate
degree.

Undergraduate Residency Requirement
To be eligible to receive a Lehigh baccalaureate degree, the candidate
must have completed either a minimum of 90 credit hours, or 60 of the
last 75 credit hours at the University or in residency programs.

Five-Year, Two-Bachelor-Degree Programs
The university’s five-year, two-degree programs enable a student to
receive two bachelor degrees upon completion of five years of study.
The civil engineering and earth and environmental sciences program
that affords two bachelor degrees, and the electrical engineering and
engineering physics two-degree program are examples of programs
in the College of Arts and Sciences and the P.C. Rossin College of
Engineering and Applied Science.
Some five-year, two-degree programs appear in the description of
courses under Arts-Engineering and Five-Year Programs. It is possible
to arrange for a dual bachelor degree program even after studying at
Lehigh for some time. Engineering students, for example, who decide
at any stage of study that they wish to meet the requirements for both
the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degree may sometimes
complete the combined requirements in five years if the decision is
made before the third year.
A student entering Lehigh to obtain a second bachelor’s degree, those
Lehigh students who wish to declare a second degree in another
college, or students wishing to pursue both a B.A. and a B.S. degree
within the College of Arts and Sciences must have a minimum of 30
additional credit hours beyond the first degree credit-hour requirements
in order to qualify for the second degree. All of the 30 additional credit

24

Advisement

hours must be taken at Lehigh or in Lehigh residency programs. All
special second degree programs must be approved by the dean of the
college in which the degree is to be offered and the Standing of Students
Committee.
Several ways exist for students to obtain two degrees in five years of
study. See listings under ARTS-Engineering; Civil Engineering and Earth
and Environmental Sciences; Electrical Engineering and Engineering
Physics; and College of Education.

Advisement
The academic advisor is one of the most valuable resources in the
educational process, not only to assist in making academic selections
to match the student’s particular background, interests, and future
objectives, but also to identify program options, to work out an academic
pace, and to develop career planning strategies. The advisor will
help to identify other resources and support systems available at the
university, such as the Center for Academic Success, Counseling and
Psychological Services, and the Center for Career and Professional
Development.
Every undergraduate in the College of Arts and Sciences and the P.C.
Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science is assigned a faculty
advisor upon matriculation. This advisor will usually change when the
student selects a major or program.

Final date for completion of requirements.

For graduation, all requirements, scholastic and financial, must have
been satisfied prior to the date stated in the university calendar.

Application for Degree
Candidates for graduation on University Day in May must file with
the registrar on or before February 1 a written notice of candidacy for
the degree; candidates for graduation in September file a notice of
candidacy on or before July 1; candidates for graduation in January file a
notice of candidacy on or before October 1.
Failure to file such notice by such dates mentioned debars the candidate
from receiving the degree as of the next consecutive graduation date.
If a petition for late filing is granted prior to the deadline to complete all
requirements, a fee is assessed.

Graduating Thesis
The original of the undergraduate thesis, when required, is accompanied
by drawings and diagrams whenever the subject needs such illustration.
The original is kept by the university, as a part of the student’s record,
for future reference; but copies may be retained by students and may be
published, provided permission has first been obtained from the faculty.

Undergraduate Credit and Grades

Every undergraduate in the College of Business and Economics
(CBE) is assigned to a professional advisor in the CBE Undergraduate
Programs Office. Once a major is declared, a faculty mentor from the
major department will be assigned for more in-depth conversations
about major courses and career paths.

A “semester hour,” used interchangeably with “credit hour,” is a course
unit normally involving three to four hours of student effort per week
during one semester. This includes both in-class contact hours and outof-class activities. The major parameters influencing the in-class/out-ofclass division include the mode of instruction and the level of the course.

Guide to Academic Rules and Regulations

Definitions of Grades

Over the years, the University has adopted numerous rules and
regulations. Some of the principal rules and regulations are given here
so that currently enrolled and potential undergraduates and graduate
students will be apprised of what is expected of them, and what they can
expect of the University.

Course grades are A, A–, B+, B, B–, C+, C, C–, D+, D, D–, P, F, N,
X, Z. The meaning of each grade is as follows: A, A–, excellent; B+,
B, and B–, good; C+ and C, competent; C–, continuation competency
(the student has achieved the level of proficiency needed for the course
to satisfy prerequisite requirements); D+, D, and D–, passing, but
performance is not adequate to take any subsequent course which
has this course as a prerequisite. P, pass-fail grading with a grade
equivalent to D– or higher; F, failing; N, incomplete; X, absent from the
final examination; Z, absent from the final examination and incomplete.

This section concerns academic regulations. Additional regulations
can be found in the Lehigh Handbook, and there is a comprehensive
statement of all policy in the publication Rules and Procedures of the
Faculty. The most up-to-date version of the Student Handbook can be
found online at http://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/handbook; the Rules and
Procedures of the Faculty can be found online on the Provost’s website.

Eligibility for Degree
In order to be graduated, a candidate for a baccalaureate degree must
achieve a minimum cumulative average of 2.00.
To be eligible for a degree, a student must not only have completed all
of the scholastic requirements for the degree, but also must have paid
all university fees, and in addition all bills for the rental of rooms in the
residence halls or in other university housing facilities. Payment also
must have been made for damage to university property or equipment,
or for any other indebtedness for scholarship loans or for loans from
trust funds administered by the university.
Responsibility for meeting academic requirements.

Each student is solely responsible for his or her progress toward
meeting specific requirements for graduation. Academic advisers,
department chairs and the associate deans staff are available to assist
the student. It is strongly recommended that the student specifically
consult with his or her adviser prior to the senior year to ascertain
eligibility for the degree for which he or she desires to qualify and to
determine that all program and hours requirements are met.
A student degree audit is available 24/7 via the online student
information system for all undergraduate students. All students are
recommended to go through this process before registering for each
semester, including each in their senior year. The student degree audit
will note all program deficiencies based on real-time academic history
and current registration information.

Grades are weighted as follows: A, 4.0; A-, 3.7; B+, 3.3; B, 3.0; B-, 2.7;
C+, 2.3; C, 2.0; C-, 1.7; D+, 1.3; D, 1.0; D-, 0.7; F, 0. WF is counted as
an F, 0. Quality points for each course are assigned according to the
number of credit hours in the course.
Other symbols used for courses on student records are: W, withdrawn;
WP, withdrawn with passing performance at the time of withdrawal;
WF, withdrawn beyond the deadline and/or with failing performance;
CR, credit allowed; NCR – no credit. NR is used when no final grade
was received from the instructor of record by the final grade submission
deadline.
Grades in the range of A through D–, P, and CR may be credited toward
baccalaureate degrees within the limits of program requirements.
Grades of F, N, X, Z, W, WP, WF, and NR cannot be credited toward the
degree. Grades of W and WP do not count as hours attempted.
Courses in which grades of D+,D, D-,F, NCR, W, WF, NR, N, X, or
Z are recorded do not meet prerequisite requirements. The student
may petition to waive a prerequisite. Upon presentation of evidence
of substantially equivalent preparation, and with the approval of the
instructor of the course, the teaching department chair and the chair of
the major department, the prerequisite will be waived.
The grade N (grade), may be used to indicate that one or more
course requirements (e.g., course report) have not been completed.
It is the obligation of the student to explain, to the satisfaction of the
instructor, that there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness or
emergency) that justify the use of the N grade. If the instructor feels the
N grade is justified, he or she assigns a grade of N supplemented by
a parenthetical letter grade, (e.g., NF). In such cases, the instructor
calculates the parenthetical grade by assigning an F (or zero score) for
any incomplete work unless he or she has informed the class in writing

Lehigh University 2016-2017

at the beginning of the course of a substitute method for determining the
default grade.
In each case in which an N grade is given, the course instructor will
provide written notification to the department chairperson stating the
name of the student receiving the grade, the reason for the incomplete
work, the work to be done for the removal of the N grade and the grade
for the work already completed.
A student who incurs an N grade in any course is required to complete
the work for the course by the fifth day of instruction in the next regular
semester. The N grade will be converted into the parenthetical grade
after the tenth day of instruction in the next regular semester, following
receipt of the N grade, unless a petition to request an extension has
been approved, or the instructor has previously changed the grade using
the removal-of-incomplete procedure. The parenthetical grade will be
dropped from the transcript after the assignment of the course grade.
The grade N may not be used to report absence from a final examination
when all other course requirements have been met.
N grades do not count as hours attempted and are not used in
computations of cumulative averages.
The grade X (grade) is used to indicate absence from the final
examination when all other course requirements have been met.
In such cases, the instructor calculates the parenthetical grade by
assigning an F (or zero score) for the missing final exam. The X grade
may be removed by a make-up examination if the absence was for good
cause (e.g., illness or other emergency). To be eligible for a make-up
exam, the student must file a petition, and the petition must be approved
by the Dean of Students. If the student fails to petition, or if the petition
is not granted, or if the student fails to appear for the scheduled makeup examination, then the X grade will be converted into the parenthetical
grade after the first scheduled make-up examination following the receipt
of the X grade. If the petition is granted and the final examination is
taken, the X grade will be changed by the instructor using the makeup examination procedures and the parenthetical grade will be dropped
from the transcript.
Where valid reasons exist for not taking the make-up examination at the
scheduled time, the student may petition for a later examination with a
fee.
The grade Z (grade) is used to indicate both absence from the final
examination and incomplete course requirements. The instructor
calculates the parenthetical grade using an F (or zero score) for the final
examination and either an F (or zero score) for incomplete coursework.
A student who incurs an Z grade in any course is required to complete
the work for the course by the fifth day of instruction in the next regular
semester. The Z grade will be converted into the parenthetical grade
after the tenth day of instruction in the next regular semester following
receipt of the Z grade. In no case shall the deadline for completion of
the work be later than the last day of classes in the first full semester in
residence (except summer) following receipt of the Z grade.
X and Z grades do not count as hours attempted and are not used in
computations of cumulative averages.
Where failure to complete coursework prevents the student from taking
the make-up examination at the scheduled time, the student may petition
the Committee on the Standing of Students for a later examination.
Grades that were originally assigned an N, X, or Z grade, when
converted or computed, will be noted with an ‘*’ asterisk prefix.
If no grade is received by the University Registrar before student
grades are officially posted, a grade of NR will be assigned. It is the
responsibility of the faculty member who failed to summit a grade to
resolve the situation. If a correct grade is not submitted or the situation is
not otherwise resolved then the NR grade will be converted to a grade of
F on the tenth day of instruction of the next academic year semester.

Scholastic Averages and Probation
Scholastic requirements for undergraduate students are expressed
in terms of the cumulative grade point average (GPA)—the weighted
average of all grades received in residence or at institutions specifically
approved for grade transfer. The cumulative GPA is computed at the
end of each semester and the second summer session. The University

25

transcript reports a student's cumulative GPA to two decimal places.
When considering cumulative GPA for graduation honors and academic
standing, the University truncates the GPA to two decimal places, with
no rounding.
Following are the cumulative GPA requirements for good standing:
freshmen to 22 earned credits
sophomores 23 to 51 earned credits
juniors and seniors with 52 or more earned credits

1.70
1.80
2.00

For computational purposes students who have completed 22 or fewer
earned hours shall be required to achieve a 1.70 cumulative grade point
average. Students who have completed 23 but fewer than 52 earned
hours at the end of the most recent graded term shall be required to
achieve a 1.80 cumulative grade point average. Students who have
completed more than 53 earned hours at the end of the most recent
graded term shall be required to achieve a 2.00 cumulative grade point
average.
Other undergraduates including all General College Division, Lehigh
Valley Association of Independent College cross registered students,
high school scholars and R.O.T.C. students will be required to achieve
a 2.0 cumulative grade point average – the minimum average required
for graduation – to remain in good academic standing. Non-degree
students with less than 12 credit hours attempted, however, will not have
their progress evaluated until they earn at least 7 credit hours total. A
non-degree student with two or more F grades is eligible to be reviewed
by and may be placed on probation or dropped for poor scholarship at
the discretion of the SOS committee.
Any undergraduate student who achieves a 1.69 or lower cumulative
grade point average in a given term is eligible to be reviewed by and
may be placed on probation at the discretion of the Committee on the
Standing of Students.
Students who do not meet the above requirements will be placed on
scholastic probation.
Students who, regardless of their cumulative averages, have failed more
than eight hours of course work in any semester are also placed on
scholastic probation.
SCHOLASTIC PROBATION

Students on scholastic probation are ineligible for (a) intercollegiate
competition and other extracurricular activities in which they publicly
represent the university; (b) major office
(elective or appointive) in any university organization; and (c) other
activities which require more time than should be diverted from primary
purposes by students whose academic survival is at risk. The Dean of
Students shall monitor and enforce this ruling.
REMOVAL FROM PROBATION

Students are removed from probation at such time as they meet the
standard listed above, effective at the end of any semester or the
second summer session.
DROPPED FOR POOR SCHOLARSHIP

A student who makes a 2.2 GPA or better in the probationary semester
but fails to meet the standards stipulated is continued on probation for
another semester. A student who makes less than a 2.2 GPA in the
probationary semester and fails to meet the standards stipulated above,
is dropped for poor scholarship.
If a student goes on scholastic probation for a second (although not
necessarily consecutive) term, a review by the Committee on the
Standing of Students will determine whether the student will continue on
scholastic probation or be dropped for poor scholarship.

Course Withdrawal
A student dropping a course within the first ten days of the semester
(five days for summer sessions) will have no record of the course on
the transcript. A student dropping all courses for which he or she is
registered is considered to be withdrawn from the university (p. 26).
A student who withdraws from a course with the approval of his/her
advisor and section instructor after the tenth day of instruction and

26

University Withdrawal

before the end of the eleventh week of instruction will have a grade of
“W” assigned to the course.

with the Registrar’s Office for limitations and processes for transfer
course approval prior to taking the courses.

A student who withdraws from a course with the approval of his/her
advisor and section instructor after the eleventh week of instruction and
before the end of classes receives a “WP” or “WF” at the discretion of
the instructor. A “WF” is considered to be a failing grade.

Release of Final Grades

An Add/Drop form signed by the student’s advisor must be
submitted to the Registrar’s Office before the deadlines noted
above to be official. No course may be dropped after the last day of
classes during a term as noted on the University Calendar.

University Withdrawal
A student withdrawing from the university (dropping all courses during
a given term) must submit the withdrawal form to the dean of students
office. Withdrawal after registration day and during the first 11 weeks
of instruction will be noted on the academic transcript by assigning a
grade of “W” to all courses. A withdrawal after the eleventh week of
instruction and before the end of classes will have the grade of “WP” or
“WF” assigned for each course at the discretion of the instructor. The
date of the withdrawal will be noted on the academic transcript for a
withdrawal at any time during the term.
A student who reduces his or her course load below the minimum
required for full time status, but does not withdraw from the university,
becomes a part-time student for the rest of that semester. Some areas
affected by part-time status are financial aid, athletic eligibility, veterans
affairs, immigration status, insurance and loan deferment.

Undergraduate Leave of Absence
Each student is expected to complete the baccalaureate degree by
attending Lehigh for four consecutive academic years. Once a student
who has matriculated at Lehigh chooses to deviate from this attendance
pattern, a revised degree plan, coordinated with his or her advisor
and associate dean, must be submitted with a request for a leave by
completing a petition to the SOS Committee for an Academic Leave
of Absence. Petitions are available from the Registrar’s Office or the
Dean of Students. The form must be signed by the student’s advisor
and the associate dean of the college, and the completed form must
be submitted prior to the start of any subsequent enrollment at another
college or university.
Current Lehigh University students are prohibited from concurrent
enrollment at any other college or university. Courses taken concurrently
will not be eligible to apply towards a Lehigh degree. An exception is
made for cross registration at another LVAIC institution.
Special opportunity programs like the American University Internship,
Hope College Urban Semester and the Institute for Shipboard Education
(affiliated with another university), University of Virginia Semester at
Sea, and Georgetown Washington Semester have limited access to
Lehigh University students. For procedures concerning application
for these programs, please see the Associate Dean of Students for
Academic Support.
Students cannot assume that a leave will be granted to study at another
college or university (this policy does not apply for study abroad through
the auspices of Lehigh Abroad or LVAIC programs). The program
of study and reason for the leave must be approved by the SOS
committee.
If unapproved leaves are taken, students are declared as non-returning
and must apply for readmission to the University through the SOS
committee if they wish to re-enroll. Courses taken at another college or
university while on an unapproved leave will not be permitted to transfer
toward a Lehigh University baccalaureate degree.
In addition, students taking an unauthorized leave of absence must be
aware that their eligibility for student aid is jeopardized.
Any student who is uncertain about attending a future fall or spring term
at Lehigh University is urged to discuss the matter with the Dean of
Students Office or the Registrar's Office prior to taking any action to
withdraw or attend another college or university.
Students may take courses at another institution during a summer term
without requesting an academic leave of absence. They should check

Grades for undergraduate students are available online as soon as
possible following the deadline for reporting of grades online using the
Banner Student Information System. Undergraduates students who
require a printed grade report must submit the request in writing to the
Registrar’s Office each term. Instructors may develop their own policies
for release of unofficial reports of academic progress to individual
students, or to their advisers, deans, or financial aid officers, on a needto-know basis, including early release of unofficial final course grades.
Any such policies must respect the rights of students to privacy.

Repeating of Courses
If a course is repeated the final grade received upon repetition of the
course is counted in the cumulative average. Only the most recent
grade and the credit associated with that course and grade counts
towards degree requirements. The original grade and associated credit
hours received will be excluded from the cumulative average and degree
requirements.
A grade that was originally received in a course may not be changed by
repeating the course under the pass-fail option.
Students repeating a course that has been graded C or better may not
overload (greater than eighteen credits) during that term.
For deletion of a grade from the cumulative average after repeating a
course, a student must:
1. file the deletion form with the registrar’s office; and
2. repeat the identical course with a final grade at Lehigh
All instances of repeated courses are displayed on the student's
academic transcript regardless of repeated status. Students are
responsible for determining any academic or financial implications for
repeating courses and for notifying the Office of the Registrar when a
course is repeated.

Pass-Fail Systems for Undergraduates
STUDENT OPTION SYSTEM

The pass-fail grading option is intended to encourage sophomore
level (and above) undergraduate students to take challenging courses
outside the major field. Courses numbered below 100 are generally not
available for optional pass/fail grading system. However, the College
offering a course may establish a petition process to determine, on
a case-by-case basis, whether a student is allowed to take a course
numbered below 100 with pass-fail grading. Courses 400 and above are
not available for the optional pass/fail grading system.
A student may register for no more than one course pass-fail numbered
above 100 and below 400 in any one semester. Students should
check the pass/fail restrictions for specific courses. He or she may
take a maximum of six courses pass-fail per undergraduate career if
the student is on a four-year program, or a maximum of eight courses
per undergraduate career with a five-year, two-degree program. If a
student changes a course from pass-fail grading to regular grading, that
course will still count toward the maximum number of courses taken
pass-fail during the student’s undergraduate career. The optional pass/
fail option may not be used for major or minor subject credit toward
graduation or for distribution requirements.
Each college faculty shall decide under what conditions and which
courses or categories of courses throughout the university may be taken
for pass-fail credit by students registered in that college, except for
courses designated specifically for pass-fail grading. Each college shall
keep the educational policy committee advised of changes in its rules.
A student designates the course(s) to be taken pass-fail normally at
preregistration but not later than the fifteenth day of instruction in a
regular semester or the fifth day of instruction in any summer session.
Prior to this deadline, the student may transfer from pass-fail to regular
grading, or vice-versa, without penalty. The courses designated for
pass-fail grading by the student require the written acknowledgment of

Lehigh University 2016-2017

the academic adviser. Retroactive changes to/from pass-fail grading
are strictly prohibited.
Since the instructor giving the course is not officially notified which
students are taking the course pass-fail, a regular letter grade is
reported to the Registrar for the pass-fail students. The Registrar then
records “P” for reported letter grades from A through D–, and “F” for a
reported letter grade of F.
Under this system, the student surrenders his or her equity to letter
grades of A through D–, except as specified below. A grade of P
applies to the student’s graduation requirements but is not used in the
computation of the cumulative average; whereas an F grade is included
in the cumulative grade point average.
Acceptance into a program that does not allow pass-fail grading in a
course is the only valid reason for converting the grade for a completed
course from pass-fail to a letter grade. If a student changes his or
her program such that a course previously taken for pass-fail grading
is not allowed for pass-fail grading in the new program, the student
must submit a petition to the Committee on the Standing of Students
requesting acceptance by the new program, or substitution of the
original letter grade submitted, or the substitution of another course.
The recommendation of the advisor must accompany the petition.

Transfer Credit
Transfer of credit from other institutions is the responsibility of the
Registrar. Any students planning to take work at other institutions in
the United States or elsewhere should initially check with the registrar's
office on policies and procedures. Full time students may not be
concurrently enrolled at any other institution, except for the LVAIC
Consortium cross registered courses, without the advanced approval
of the Committee on Standing of Students. Transfer of grades from
institutions other than the LVAIC System is not possible.
• Pass/Fail credit/non-credit courses are not acceptable for transfer.
• Courses taken at a two year or four year institution where a grade
lower than a “C” has been earned will not transfer. (“C-” or below will
not transfer)
• Transfer courses may not be used to delete a prior grade from
one’s cumulative grade point average at Lehigh University. Transfer
grades are NOT calculated in the Lehigh GPA.
• No student may receive more credit at Lehigh than was granted
at the original institution. Courses taken on the quarter system will
have credit granted on a 3-2 ratio, no partial credit will be awarded.
The student will receive credit equivalent to the number of credits
indicated on the transcript, up to the number of credits for the
equivalent course at Lehigh. The registrar has the final authority for
the amount of credit awarded toward a Lehigh degree.
• No credit will be granted for a course in which the student has
already received credit for its equivalent at Lehigh.
• No credit will be granted for continuing education units courses,
correspondence, independent study or any course less than 3 weeks
and/or 15 contact hours per credit without the advanced approval of
a petition to the Standing of Students Committee.
• Students requesting transfer credit for online courses must submit
the online course syllabus to the Registrar's Office for review.
• Courses taken through dual enrollment programs while in high
school must have been taught by a faculty member of the creditawarding college or university in order to be considered for transfer
credit. Additional verification paperwork is required to begin the
transfer credit process.
• Courses must be taken at an institution that is accredited by one of
the six regional associations.

27

in the future. A student completing a course in this manner will have
the course and the notation AU indicated on the permanent record. A
student rostered on an audit basis may be withdrawn from the course
with a grade of W for poor attendance. Audit courses do not count
toward full-time status.

Review-Consultation-Study Period
The Review-Consultation-Study (RCS) period is intended to provide a
period of time for informal academic work between the end of the formal
instruction period and the beginning of the final examinations.
It is expected that students will use this period to consolidate their
command of the material in their courses. Faculty members make
themselves available to their students at announced times during this
period.
No quiz or exam may be given during the last five class days before final
examination period begins and the RCS period.

Graduation Honors
Beginning with all new degree seeking students in the Fall of 2004 or
any students graduating in the Spring of 2008, degrees with honors are
awarded by vote of the university faculty to those students who have
attained an average of not less than 3.40 in a minimum of 90 credit
hours in residence at Lehigh University or in programs approved by the
faculty to have grades and credit accepted toward the undergraduate
degree.
Degrees with high honors are awarded by vote of the university faculty
to those students who have attained an average of not less than 3.60
in a minimum of 90 credit hours in residence at Lehigh University or in
programs approved by the faculty to have grades and credit accepted
toward the undergraduate degree.
Degrees with highest honors are awarded by vote of the university
faculty to those students who have attained an average of not less than
3.80 in a minimum of 90 credit hours in residence at Lehigh University or
in programs approved by the faculty to have grades and credit accepted
toward the undergraduate degree.
For the purposes of graduation honors calculations, courses taken more
than once at Lehigh will only have the most recent grade used in the
calculation. Courses taken under the cross-registration policy of the
LVAIC and the Washington Semester program will be used.
Students who spend part of their career at another institution, or are
transfer admits to degree programs, must have at least sixty earned
credit hours of regularly graded (not pass/fail) courses that meet the
residency requirement in order to be eligible for graduation honors.

Department Honors
Many departments offer honors work adapted to its curriculum for
students who wish to demonstrate unusual academic ability and interest
in exploring a chosen field through independent study and research.
The precise nature of the program for each student is determined by
the academic major department, but may include: unscheduled work or
independent study, participation in graduate (400-level) courses, and an
honors thesis or project.
Qualified candidates should inform their academic advisers by the end
of the junior year of their intention to work for departmental honors.
The adviser will give the college and the registrar names of graduating
seniors working for departmental honors in particular majors. Student
names will be published on the Commencement home page.

Honor Societies

Course Auditing

There are at least 18 honor and course societies. The three best-known
are:

A student who is in good academic standing and has not failed any
courses in the previous term may be approved to audit not more
than one course per semester, which must be outside the curriculum
requirements. Application to audit a course is by petition approved by
the departmental chair and the Standing of Students Committee. In no
case shall a student who has attended a course as an auditor be given
an anticipatory examination for credit or register for the same course

Phi Beta Kappa. The oldest honor society in the United States is
represented at Lehigh by the Beta chapter of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, the 27th oldest chapter in the nation. The chapter’s
council considers for invitation into its membership those students in
each of Lehigh’s three undergraduate colleges who satisfy the following
profile:

28

Beta Kappa. Any undergraduate who has questions about any of the
items in this profile should contact Prof. Scott Paul Gordon, Executive
Secretary of Lehigh’s chapter. Office phone: 610-758-3307; e-mail:
spg4@lehigh.edu
Beta Gamma Sigma. Election to membership in Beta Gamma Sigma
is the highest scholastic honor that a student in business administration
can achieve. Beta Gamma Sigma is the only national honorary
scholarship society in the field of business administration recognized by
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.
Tau Beta Pi. Tau Beta Pi recognizes engineering students who have
a history of distinguished scholarship and exemplary character. The
national organization was founded at Lehigh in 1885. A bronze marker in
front of Packard Lab commemorates this event.
Among course societies are the following: Alpha Pi Mu, for those in
industrial and systems engineering; Alpha Sigma Mu, materials science
and engineering (http://www.alphasigmamu.org/). Beta Alpha Psi,
accounting; Chi Epsilon, civil engineering; Eta Kappa Nu, electrical

English; and Sigma Xi, research.

Special Undergraduate Academic Opportunities
The academic programs in the colleges are supplemented by five-year,
two-degree programs as well as opportunities for advanced, foreign, and
experiential study.
ARTS-ENGINEERING OPTION

The curriculum in arts-engineering is designed for students wanting a
professional education in a field of engineering and also the opportunity
to study a second field.
Arts-engineers fulfill all requirements for the professional engineering
degree for which they are working. However, the first three years of
science and engineering courses are scheduled over four years for the
arts-engineer. During this period the arts-engineer is a student in the
College of Arts and Science pursuing a bachelor of arts or bachelor of
science major program.
In many instances it may be advisable to take the two degrees at the
end of the fifth year. Arts-engineers working towards the bachelor of
science in biology, computer science, environmental science, geological
sciences, geophysics, molecular biology, and statistics are advised to
pay special attention to the engineering humanities and social science
requirements, which must be met in time for the student to qualify for the
B.S. in engineering.
Arts-engineers have the same opportunities for multiple majors and
special interdisciplinary majors as are available to students working for
the baccalaureate (B.S. or B.A. degree only) in the College of Arts and
Sciences. Additional information may be obtained by contacting Prof.
Bruce Thomas, Art and Architecture, Chandler-Ullmann.

BACHELOR/MASTER DEGREE PROGRAMS

Of increasing interest to undergraduates are the two-degree programs
that may lead to both a bachelor and a master’s degree in five years.
The fifth-year program in the School of Education enables those
receiving a B.A. or B.S. degree to accomplish professional teacher
training and serve as salaried interns in public schools. After the
completion of one year of full-time teaching, secondary teachers can
receive the master of arts and elementary teachers can receive master
of education degrees.
Many other five-year, graduate-level combination programs exist, and
students are advised to consult with their adviser in planning such
programs. All students receiving masters degrees must be registered as
full time degree graduate students for at least one full term.

Apprentice Teaching
The apprentice teaching program is designed to benefit juniors and
seniors who wish to learn about teaching under the guidance of
an experienced teacher. Apprentices often do a limited amount of
supervised lecturing or leading of discussions, assist in making up
and evaluating written assignments, and are available for individual
consultation with students.
To participate in the apprentice teaching program a student must:
1. Have an over-all cumulative grade point average of 2.80 or better;
2. Have a cumulative major grade point average of at least 3.3 and
have completed at least two courses in the major field in which
apprentice teaching is done;
3. Have previously taken for credit the course or its equivalent in which
the apprentice teaching will be done;
4. Meet the guidelines on file in each college dean’s office.
A student may register for apprentice teaching only once each semester,
only once in a given course, and only twice during a college career.
To register for apprentice teaching each student-teacher partnership
will submit an apprentice teaching agreement, indicating the duties
and obligations for approval to the department chair and the dean of
the student’s college in which the course is taken. This form must be
submitted to the registrar before the first day of classes in the semester.
To complete the course, the apprentice teachers must submit a written
report of their experience to the supervising teacher, who will forward it
to the Office of the Provost.

English as a Second Language

www.lehigh.edu/esl
English as a Second Language (ESL) at Lehigh offers a variety of yearround courses and private tutoring for undergraduate and graduate
students who would like to improve their academic English skills and
their understanding of American pragmatics and culture.
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT CREDIT COURSES

Undergraduate students who are non-native speakers of English and
have lived and studied in the US for less than four years will register for
ENGL 003 and ENGL 005 (Composition and Literature for International
Writers I and II) as their required first-year English composition
courses. These two courses, taken consecutively in the Fall and Spring
semesters, are designed specifically with international writers in mind
and substitute for ENGL 001 and ENGL 002 general composition
courses. Those first-year international undergraduate students who
need additional focused practice with their American English speaking,
listening, and pragmatic skills may be required to register for ENGL 015
(Speech Communication for International Speakers).
ESL PROGRAM (ESLP) COURSES

Graduate students can register for credit courses (one credit each)
in academic writing, speaking & listening, and advanced academic
presentations offered in both Fall and Spring semesters. Please refer

Lehigh University 2016-2017

to the English as a Second Language course offerings for registration
information.

Curricular Flexibility

STEPUP INTENSIVE ENGLISH PROGRAM

Choice is a regular part of university life, and encompasses the
determination of a college and major, the selection of courses each
term, and the development of life goals and career options.

The StepUp Program is a rigorous, non-credit English program for
admitted Lehigh students who are required to further improve their
English skills prior to taking credit courses at Lehigh University.
StepUp enhances students' English skills in advanced academic
reading and writing, spoken academic language, and American
pragmatics. StepUp also serves as an excellent orientation to the
Lehigh University culture. For program information, dates, fees, and
registration forms, visit the ESL website: www. (http://www.lehigh.edu/
~inesl/StepUp)global.lehigh.edu/esl.
INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE CENTER (IELC)

Graduate students can register for private tutoring appointments in
ESL's International English Language Center (IELC). In each semesterlong program, students will study individually with a professional
ESL teacher utilizing a curriculum specifically customized to each
student's interests and needs. For program information, dates, fees, and
registration forms, visit the ESL website: www.lehigh.edu/~inesl.

Credit by Examination
Upon petition and presentation of evidence that he or she has qualified
for it, a student already enrolled at Lehigh may be permitted by the
Standing of Students Committee to take a special examination for
credit towards graduation. Special examinations are granted only for
extraordinary reasons and upon petition. There must be adequate
supporting evidence of sufficient cause accompanying each petition.
There is a fee for all special examinations.
Students taking a special exam after matriculation at Lehigh will have
the grade and credits assigned to their permanent Lehigh record.
Special exam credit will be counted as in residence credit and the grade
will be used in all grade point average calculations. No special exam will
be granted in a course that the student has already taken (except senior
reexaminations) for credit or on an audit basis, or in a course in which
the student has already completed more advanced work at Lehigh.

Preparation for Graduate Work
Students planning to continue in graduate programs should take
advantage of the flexibility in many undergraduate programs to design
an upper-division curriculum that meets requirements in the anticipated
graduate program.
The policies of the colleges provides as much flexibility as possible for
students who wish to change to new but related fields of study after
the baccalaureate degree. Students should consult with their previous
program adviser and the department representative of the new field
to establish an academic program that will remedy any deficiencies in
background.

Guidelines for Undergraduates to Take Graduate Level
Courses
1. No undergraduate student may take 400-level courses during a
term where the student’s total credits are greater than 18 (including
audits).
2. All students receiving a graduate degree must be enrolled one full
semester or summer as a regular student prior to the awarding of a
graduate degree.
3. An undergraduate student may use no more than 12 credits taken as
an undergraduate toward a graduate degree. These courses must
be at the 300 and 400 level and beyond all undergraduate degree
requirements.
4. Students should have achieved junior standing and a grade point
average of 3.0 to take 400 level courses.
5. Students must petition the Standing of Graduate Students and the
Standing of Students for permission.
6. Students requesting a second graduate level course in a given
term must petition the Standing of Graduate students committee.
(Students should not expect to take a second graduate level course
if enrolled for more than 15 credits.)

29

Many of these choices are academic in nature. The undergraduate
curricula are flexible, designed to accommodate the changing interests
and needs of students. Boundaries between colleges are fluid, providing
many options in an educational program. For instance, students may
take a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree in the College of Business and
Economics or the College of Engineering and Applied Science with a
minor in journalism in the College of Arts and Sciences. There are fiveyear programs for which degrees are awarded in two colleges.
Students who wish to transfer from one undergraduate college to
another may do so provided that they have achieved sophomore
status and have completed at least 12 credits while in their college of
matriculation. Students on academic probation may transfer between
colleges with the permission of the committee on standing of students.
In addition, each receiving college may require the completion (with
a minimum grade of C-) of no more than three introductory courses
– courses without prerequisites – before transfer occurs. Students
considering such a transfer must confer with their advisers to begin the
process. Students who transfer to another college may require more
than the traditional eight semesters to complete the course sequence in
their degree program.
The College of Business and Economics requires a student to
successfully complete either MATH 081 or MATH 021, and ECO 001
before transferring to that college. Courses considered equivalent
to these courses will also satisfy the requirement such as approved
transfer credit (including AP courses) for these courses taken at other
institutions, or the successful completion of MATH 075 and MATH 076,
or MATH 031, which are equivalent to MATH 021.

Provisional Courses
Instructional departments may introduce provisional courses temporarily
within a semester, either experimentally or as a response to a
contemporary social or scientific issue. If successful, such courses may
become a permanent part of the university curriculum. These courses,
identified with a 95, 96, 97 or 98 number (preceded by a 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
indicating level) may be offered for a maximum of two years.

LVAIC Cross-Registration
Currently enrolled full-time degree seeking undergraduate students
in good academic standing who have achieved sophomore status
may register for up to two courses per term at any one of the member
institutions (DeSales University, Cedar Crest College, Lafayette College,
Moravian College, and Muhlenberg College). The student must obtain
the appropriate approvals of his or her own adviser and the host
institution registrar. The courses must not be available at the home
institution and must be in the normal academic load and not produce an
overload. Graduate students and courses (courses numbered 400 and
above) are not eligible for cross registration.
All grades of courses taken through the LVAIC cross registration
process will be accepted by the home institution and entered on the
permanent record, and such grades will be used in computing the grade
point average. Credits taken through the cross-registration process will
be calculated as in-residence. The number of credit hours assigned to a
course is the responsibility of the home institution registrar.
Students may not repeat a course at another LVAIC institution in
which they expect to have a Lehigh cumulative grade point average
adjustment.
Lehigh University students are not permitted to cross-register for
courses in all January intersession programs, the evening program at
Muhlenberg College, all weekend courses at Cedar Crest College, or the
Access program at DeSales University. All independent study, tutorial,
music lessons or groups, correspondence, and on line courses are
prohibited from cross-registration without prior approval of the Lehigh
University Standing of Students Committee.

General College Division
The General College Division provides an opportunity for qualified
persons not planning to seek a degree to pursue work of a general or
specialized nature that their preparation and interests make desirable;
provides a trial period for those who wish to become candidates for
baccalaureate or graduate degrees, but whose preparation does not
satisfy the entrance requirements for the established curricula; and
provides an opportunity for qualified students to continue their education
without being committed to a restricted or specialized program of
studies. Courses taken in the General College Division may not be
submitted to meet the requirements for a graduate degree.
For admission to the General College Division, the student must submit
a special, simplified application to the undergraduate admissions office;
the application must be submitted at least one month prior to the start of
the semester in which the student hopes to enroll. The applicant must
show maturity, seriousness of purpose and evidence of ability to pursue
with profit the program of studies he or she desires. The student must
have the established prerequisites for courses in which he or she wishes
to enroll, and may register for courses up to and including those at the
300-level. 400-level courses are prohibited.
There is no established curriculum for the General College Division.
Each student works on a program outlined to meet his or her special
needs. Each program must be approved by the University Registrar and/
or their designee, who serves as the director of the division. Students
must obtain permission of the instructor for each course in which they
seek to enroll each semester. Students in this division are granted final
approval for enrollment on a case by case and space available basis.
Students in the division are not permitted to take courses using the
optional pass/fail grading system, course audit, or cross register for
courses in LVAIC.
Students in the division, as non-degree candidates, do not meet the
eligibility criteria for federal student aid, under Title IV, including Federal
Pell Grants and Federal Stafford Student Loans. Similarly, institutional
financial aid also is limited to degree candidates.
Students in the division are not candidates for degrees and must
maintain a minimum 2.00 grade point average. A student may transfer
to regular matriculated undergraduate status in any of the colleges
only upon petition to, and with the approval of, the Committee on the
Standing of Students. Transfer to the graduate school is possible only
through the normal graduate admission process.
With the exception above, students in the General College Division are
subject to the same rules and regulations as students of the university.
They pay the tuition and fees established for regularly matriculated
students.

Graduate Study and Research
Lehigh began awarding graduate degrees in 1882. The first recipient,
T.H. Hardcastle, of the Class of 1880, wrote his thesis on Alexander
Pope, entitled it The Rights of Man, and read it aloud at commencement
in June 1882.
The first Ph.D. was granted in 1893 to Joseph W. Richards, Class
of 1886. Richards, who had a background in metallurgy and
electrochemistry, taught at Lehigh until his death in 1921.
Women were admitted to the graduate program in 1918 when the faculty
and the board of trustees agreed to grant the degrees of M.A. and M.S.
to women, provided they attended classes in the late afternoon and
on Saturdays “so that the general character of campus life shall not be
affected.” Three women received graduate degrees in 1921, the first
women to complete graduate work at Lehigh. In 1929, the rule was
changed, and women were admitted on much the same basis as men.
In 1936, the Graduate School was established to administer the
graduate program. The Ph.D., which was temporarily discontinued
in 1894, was reinstated in nine departments: chemistry, chemical
engineering, civil engineering, geology, history, mathematics,
mechanical engineering, metallurgical engineering, and physics.
Tomlinson Fort, professor of mathematics, was selected in 1938 as the
first dean of the Graduate School.
In 1995, graduate programs were decentralized and are now
administered by the four colleges of the university, as described below.
COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES

Donald Hall, dean
Dominic Packer, associate dean for research and graduate programs
The College of Arts and Sciences offers graduate degrees in the
humanities, social sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences. The
master of arts, master of science, and the doctor of philosophy degrees
are given in most of the traditional academic departments and in some
interdisciplinary programs. Advanced degrees may be obtained in the
departments of biological sciences, chemistry, earth and environmental
sciences, english, history, mathematics, physics, political science,
psychology, and sociology. In addition, interdisciplinary degrees are
available in American studies, environmental policy design, photonics,
and polymer science and engineering.
Although degree requirements vary from department to department,
most require a combination of formal coursework and independent
research. Students work closely with a faculty adviser in formulating and
carrying out their research programs. Students admitted to a traditional
department who are interested in an interdisciplinary approach may
design a program of study and research which draws on faculty and
facilities in other areas of the college or university.
For the most up to date information, interested students should check
the CAS graduate website (http://cas.lehigh.edu/grad) or contact
the Office of Research and Graduate Programs, College of Arts and

Graduate study in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied
Science is most often related to the college’s extensive research
activity, and graduate students are expected to engage in analytical or
experimental research as part of their programs of study. This activity
involves students in the process of creating new knowledge under the
direction of the college’s distinguished faculty and brings them into
contact with some of the most modern and advanced experimental
techniques. Many college research programs are supported by
contracts, fellowships, and grants from industry and from federal, state,
and local governments. This funding not only provides financial support
for outstanding students but also allows them to deal with some of the
more complex and pressing problems facing our society in the 21st
century.
Many faculty members and graduate students in the P.C. Rossin
College of Engineering and Applied Science are associated with
interdisciplinary research centers and institutes as well as with their own
departments. The opportunity for interdisciplinary study allows them
to cross departmental lines in specific technological areas and to work
with faculty and graduate students from other departments. Centers
and institutes perform research that fall under five broad categories:
materials and nanotechnology, infrastructural systems, applied life
science and bioengineering, energy and the environment, and complex
engineering systems. Information on individual centers and specific

research activities can be found at URL www.lehigh.edu/engineering/
research/centers/. Extensive research in many of these areas is also
conducted within academic departments.
Further information on the graduate programs may be obtained through
the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, P.C. Rossin College of
Engineering and Applied Science, 19 Memorial Drive West, Bethlehem,
PA 18015.

Admission to Graduate Study
A graduate of an accredited college or university may be considered
for admission to graduate study. The decision to admit a student
rests with the applicant’s major department and stands for one year
following the first semester for which admission was offered. If more
than one year elapses, the prospective student’s department reserves
the right to reconsider the original offer. Students wishing to pursue
an interdisciplinary degree may, in some cases, apply to the program
directly.
Applications for admission may be completed online at https://
www.applyweb.com/lehighg/index.ftl
An applicant may enter the graduate program as a student in the
following categories: regular, associate, or non-degree. Except for
qualified Lehigh undergraduates, only those who have been admitted
officially by the graduate program office of an appropriate college or by
a department in one of the categories above may register for graduate
courses or take them for credit.
REGULAR GRADUATE STUDENTS

Only regular graduate students are candidates for graduate degrees.
Application for admission as a regular graduate student must be filed
by July 15 for the following fall semester or by Dec. 1 for the spring
semester. Regular graduate students wishing to begin in the summer
must apply before April 30. Certain departments or programs have
earlier deadlines. Applicants should consult their respective departments
or their dean's office. In order to be considered for admission as a
regular graduate student, the applicant must satisfy at least one of the
following conditions: have an undergraduate GPA of at least 2.75 out of
4.00 (note: College of Education GPA minimum is 3.0); have an average
of at least 3.00 for the last two semesters of undergraduate study;
have a graduate grade point average of at least 3.00 for a minimum of
twelve credit hours of graduate work completed at other institutions; or
have successfully satisfied the probationary conditions as an associate
graduate student (discussed below). Satisfying one of these conditions
is necessary for admission as a regular graduate student but may not be
the only condition required.
Graduate students who are non-native speakers of English are required
to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language Internet-Based
Test (TOEFL iBT). Please contact your department or program of
choice for the required acceptance scores. Please also note that the
TOEFL Paper-Based Test (PBT) and the TOEFL Computer-Based Test
(CBT) have been discontinued and are no longer valid for admissions
purposes.
The TOEFL iBT may be waived if a student has obtained a degree
from an English language university in an English speaking country
and demonstrates effective English language skills. Applicants should
consult with their respective departments or program of choice to
confirm whether they are eligible for a TOEFL iBT waiver.
Individual departments may evaluate their candidates for admission
according to higher standards and additional criteria. Students seeking
admission to Professional Certification Programs may have to meet
additional requirements to comply with Pennsylvania Department of
Education Regulations. Departments should be consulted for information
regarding required examinations for admission. For example, candidates
for the MBA program are required to take the Graduate Management
Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Exam. In some
cases, GRE subject tests are required.
Admission of a student to graduate standing is executed through the
Office of Graduate Studies in each college or the respective dean’s
office. Credentials for admission to counseling psychology and school
psychology programs and to all College of Education doctoral programs
are acted upon only once a year.

Lehigh University 2016-2017

Completed applications accompanied by requests for financial aid must
be submitted by January 15 for admission in the following fall semester.
(Some departments have earlier deadlines.) Applications received after
the deadline will be considered on a space-available basis.
ASSOCIATE GRADUATE STUDENTS

limit for regular non-degree students. A student admitted as non-degree
may subsequently be admitted to a degree program, but would need
to submit all components required for admissions consideration by
that degree program. Students should consult their respective college
dean's office for proper procedure.

Associate graduate student status may be offered to applicants who
apply but fail to qualify for regular graduate student status. Only
associate student applications will be considered during the late
admissions period between the end of the regular admission period
and the first day of classes. Applicants for associate status may submit
unofficial rather than official transcripts; letters of recommendation are
not required at that time. However, the registrar will require an official
final transcript before grades are released. Certain departments or
programs have earlier deadlines and more stringent requirements.
Applicants should consult their respective departments.

GRADUATE COURSE AUDITING

Associate graduate students who are admitted during the late admission
period and who clearly qualify for admission as regular graduate
students may petition for regular status after classes begin if all
credentials are in order. There is no late application fee. Individual
departments may have more stringent requirements.

LEHIGH UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATES

Associate graduate students are allowed to take up to nine credits of
coursework numbered 300 or higher before they must petition for regular
student status. In order to be granted regular student status, they must
have completed those nine credits with at most one final course mark
below B-. Associate graduate students receiving a final course mark
lower than a C- will be dropped from the program. Students should note
that individual departments may impose more rigorous probationary
standards. For example, the College of Education has more stringent
probationary standards; please see the handbook for details.

33

With the permission of the departmental chair, graduate students can
be admitted to a course as auditors. This course will not count for credit
towards any graduate degree, and may not subsequently be taken for
credit. In no case shall a student who has attended a course as an
auditor be given an anticipatory examination for credit or register for the
same course in the future. A student completing a course in this manner
will have the course and the notation “AU” indicated on the permanent
record. A student rostered on an audit basis may be withdrawn from the
course with a grade of “W” for poor attendance.
A Lehigh undergraduate with a 3.0 cumulative grade point average who
has achieved Junior standing may take any 400-level course for which
he or she is qualified. The qualifications are defined by the department
and are certified by the course instructor and department chairperson
through petition to the Graduate and Research Committee. Additional
information on constraints on undergraduates taking graduate level
can be found in Guidelines for Undergraduates to Take Graduate Level
Courses (p. 29).

When the probationary period of nine credit hours is completed,
associate graduate students must petition for regular student status in
order to enroll for additional coursework. Such a petition requires the
submission of any regular admission documents not already on file.
Courses completed during a successful probationary period may count
toward a graduate degree if they are part of an approved program.

Undergraduates at Lehigh who are within a few hours of meeting the
requirements for a baccalaureate degree may, with the special approval
of the Graduate and Research Committee, enroll for up to 12 credit
hours of study for graduate credit (6 in the P.C. Rossin College of
Engineering and Applied Science). Lehigh undergraduates may apply
course credits taken in the undergraduate program toward a graduate
degree under the following conditions: 1) the course credits are not
submitted as part of the requirement for an undergraduate degree; and
2) courses for possible graduate credit are approved in advance by the
course instructor, department chairperson, and the dean of the college.
The student must receive a final course mark of B- or better.

NON-DEGREE STUDENTS

READMISSION

Students who do not wish to enter a degree program may seek
admission with non-degree status. In this case, the prospective student
completes an abbreviated application form which can be completed
online at https://www.applyweb.com/lehighg/index.ftl

A student who has not been registered in a Lehigh graduate program
for one year must petition for readmission. Petitions approved by the
student’s major department must be forwarded to the registrar’s office.

The admissions criteria for non-degree graduate students are: 1) a
bachelor’s degree from an approved institution with an overall grade
point average of at least 3.0; (applicants with undergraduate GPAs
below 3.0 may be admitted with the approval of the department in which
they wish to take courses;) or 2) evidence that the applicant is presently
a student in good standing in an appropriate graduate program at an
approved institution; or 3) evidence that the applicant has received
an appropriate graduate or other advanced degree from an approved
institution. In addition, non-native English speakers are required to
demonstrate English language skills equal to those required of degreeseeking students and are held to the same TOEFL standards.

International applicants must hold an American bachelor’s degree or
an equivalent foreign degree requiring at least 16 years of primary,
secondary, and university education. International applicants applying
for regular graduate student status must submit all documents required
for that status (see above).

Admission decisions for non-degree students are made by the dean
of the appropriate college or other responsible official designated by
him/her for this purpose. The signature of the designated official on the
application and registration forms confers admission to the non-degree
graduate student status. Informal transcripts will be accepted for initial
admission, but formal transcripts must be on record before the student
can receive any transcript or grade report from the university or enroll for
additional courses.
Non-degree Options

In addition to degree programs, there are two non-degree options:
1) Regular non-degree and 2) Non-degree for external certification.
Regular non-degree admission is for students who wish to take up to 12
credits of graduate coursework without seeking a degree. Non-degree
for external certification students are admitted to pursue coursework for
the purpose of obtaining certification through an external accrediting
agency. These students complete coursework for the appropriate
certification, with the number of credits being dictated by the external
accrediting agency. Given this external control of credit requirements,
the number of credits will vary and will typically exceed the 12-credit

INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS

Registration
REQUIREMENTS

All graduate students using Lehigh University resources must be
registered. No graduate student may register for more than 16 credits
per semester. University employees may register for, at most, two
courses per semester with appropriate approval. The maximum
registration in a summer session is two concurrent courses and no more
than 14 summer credits across all summer sessions.
REGISTRATION PROCEDURE

Registration is scheduled for a two-week period at a time designated
on the university calendar. Graduate registration for new students is
held during the week preceding the start of classes. Students should
check with their departments for registration and semester class
schedules. Graduate students may register using the online system
after consultation with their adviser, or complete paper registration
forms available in their departments. A course adviser will discuss
course selections with students and provide the registration PIN or sign
registration forms upon approval.
LATE REGISTRATION PENALTIES

Registration after the designated period during the prior term for
continuing full-time graduate students or between the second and
tenth day of class during the fall and spring semesters, and the second
and fifth day of class during the summer sessions will require a late

34

Graduate Credit and Grades

registration fee. Students who have not completed the registration
process by the tenth day of the regular academic semester or by the fifth
day of the summer session will not be permitted to attend class.
FULL-TIME STATUS

In order to maintain full-time enrollment status, a graduate student must
ordinarily register for a minimum of nine credits each semester. Fulltime students may not be employed full-time. Identification as a full-time
student is important for three purposes:
1. eligibility for financial aid,
2. compliance with visa requirements for international students, and
3. for university and national graduate enrollment data.
Full-time status may be maintained with fewer than nine credits of
registration after fulfillment of degree credit-hour requirements and
under some other selected circumstances, provided that the student
is, in fact, continuing a program of full-time study and research. In such
cases, the status must be certified each semester on the Graduate Full
Time Certification request form, first by the department and then by the
appropriate college.

Graduate Credit and Grades
Course grades are defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that, at
a minimum, no final course mark lower than C- may be counted toward
a graduate degree and pass-fail registration is not allowed for graduate
students. No regularly admitted student who receives more than four
final course marks below a B- in courses numbered 200 or higher is
allowed to continue registration as a graduate student. Individual degree
programs may have higher standards.
The N grade is defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that,
parenthetical grades are not required for thesis or research courses and
graduate students have a calendar year to remove course incomplete
grades unless an earlier deadline is specified by the instructor. Graduate
student incomplete course grades that are not removed remain as N
or N (grade) on the student record for one year. After one year, the
N grade will be converted to an F and the N (grade) will be converted
to the parenthetical letter grade. Incomplete grades may be extended
an additional year with approval of the course instructor and the
graduate coordinator. After two years, outstanding incomplete grades
will be converted to an F or the parenthetical mark. After two years,
students may appeal to the Committee on Standing of Graduate
Students (SOGS) with a timeline and plan for completion. Thesis or
research project N grades may remain beyond one year until the work is
completed.
The X grade is defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that to be
eligible for a make-up examination a graduate student must file a petition
and the petition must be approved by the Graduate and Research
Committee. The instructor schedules and administers the make-up
exam.

on the academic transcript. A student that drops all courses for which he
or she is registered is considered to be withdrawing from the university.
A student who withdraws from a course after the tenth day of instruction
and before the end of the eleventh week of instruction will have a final
course mark of “W” assigned to the course. This is a non-punitive
grade.
A student who withdraws from a course after the eleventh week of
instruction and before the end of classes receives a “WP” or “WF” at
the discretion of the instructor. A “WF” is considered to be a failing
grade and is calculated as such in the term and cumulative grade point
average. An Add/Drop form signed by the student’s adviser must be
submitted to the registrar’s office before the deadlines noted to be
official.
UNIVERSITY WITHDRAWAL

A student withdrawing from the university (dropping all courses during
a given term) must submit the Drop/Add form signed by the adviser to
the registrar’s office. Withdrawal after registration day and during the first
eleven weeks of instruction will be noted on the academic transcript by
assigning a final course mark of “W” to all courses. A withdrawal after
the eleventh week of instruction and before the end of classes will have
the grade of “WP” or “WF” assigned for each course at the discretion of
the instructor. The date of the withdrawal will be noted on the academic
transcript for a withdrawal at any time during the term.
GRADUATE STUDENT SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS

The following guidelines state the minimum requirements for all graduate
students. Individual degree programs may have higher standards.
Associate and Non-Degree Students

Associate and Non-Degree Students will be placed on probation
when they receive their first final course mark below a “B-” and will be
dropped for poor scholarship at the end of a term when the student has
accumulated either two “C”, “C-” or “C+” final course marks or one final
course mark below “C-”.
If an associate student is assigned two grades below a “B-” in the same
term the student is eligible to be dropped without any term on probation.
Once on probation, students remain on probation until they are granted
regular status or receive degree. Students who are eligible to be granted
regular status but fail to apply by the regular student deadline will be
evaluated according to the regular student criteria.
Regular Students

Regular Students will be placed on probation at the end of the term
in which they are assigned their fourth final course mark below a
“B-” in courses numbered 200 or above and will be dropped for poor
scholarship at the end of any term in which they are assigned their fifth
final course mark below a “B-”.
Once regular students are placed on probation they will remain on
probation until they receive their degrees.

The Z grade is defined as for undergraduates (p. 24) except that
graduate students have a calendar year to complete coursework
following a Z grade unless an earlier completion deadline is specified
by the instructor. The X portion of the grade is removed as described
for undergraduates. Z grades which are not removed remain on the
record of graduate students. All petitions for exceptions are sent to the
Committee on Standing of Graduate Students (SOGS).

Readmission

A student’s grade that was originally assigned an N, X or Z grade when
converted or computed will be noted with an “*” asterisk prefix.

Graduate Leave of Absence

REPEATED COURSE POLICY

Graduate Student Leave of Absence Policy

If a graduate student repeats a course, each time that course is taken
it is included in the academic record, as is the final grade assigned,
and both appear on the official student academic transcript. All final
course grades assigned are included in the calculation of the student's
cumulative grade point average. Course credits from a repeated
course, however, count only once toward satisfying graduation credit
requirements.

During the course of graduate study, students may find themselves in
circumstances that require them to interrupt their graduate work. When
these occasions arise, the University allows students to request a leave
of absence for either personal or medical reasons. The information
provided below is designed to assist students in making a smooth
transition away from graduate study and then back again.

WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSE

When a student drops a course within the first ten days of the semester
(five days for summer sessions) no indication of this action is recorded

Graduate students who have been dropped for poor scholarship are
ineligible to enroll for the next regular term. After one term away they
may petition for readmission. The department and the dean’s office
must review the petition. If approved, the student will be readmitted on
probation and may be dropped again with any additional final course
marks below a “B-”.

Students are required to submit the Leave of Absence Request
form to the Office of Graduate Student Life. If the student is eligible,
the Office of Graduate Student Life will then notify the academic
adviser, program director, department chair, graduate associate dean
of the appropriate college and the registrar. In order to enhance their

Lehigh University 2016-2017

successful return to graduate school, students are strongly encouraged
to meet with their advisers to discuss their plans and to keep the lines of
communication open.
Please note that a “withdrawal” indicates the student intends to
discontinue graduate study, whereas a “Leave of Absence” indicates
that the student intends to return at a specified later date. This policy
address leaves after which the student intends to return and resume his
or her studies.
Important Information about Requested Leaves of Absence:
• Only students who have successfully completed at least one
semester of graduate work and are in good academic standing are
eligible for a leave of absence. Students in their first semester who
request a leave will need to petition for readmission.
• Funded students who are requesting a leave due to the birth or
adoption of a child should apply for a Graduate Student Parental
Leave. Students can access information and the form here:
http://www.lehigh.edu/~inprv/pdfs/
GraduateStudentParentalLeavePolicy11-17-09withForm.pdf
• The University will grant a leave of absence for up to one year. If
more time away is required, students may request a second year
of leave. Should students require more than two years away from
the University, they will be required to apply for readmission to the
program at the end of their time away. A leave that commences
during the semester will count as an entire semester away in terms
of total leave time allowed.
• If students take a leave during the semester, they may be
required to submit a drop/add form to the Registrar’s Office (http://
www.lehigh.edu/~inengrit/gradforms/pdfs/add_drop.pdf). Students
may be eligible for a prorated refund. Please consult the Bursar’s
Office for details: (http://www.lehigh.edu/~inburs/refund.html).
• An approved leave of absence extends the time-to-degree deadline
for the length of the approved leave, but only up to the universitymandated maximum of two years.
• While on leave, students are not registered with the University. This
has important implications:
• The student may not submit work, take exams, propose or defend
theses or dissertations, or use faculty time.
• The student will not have access to University services, including
the Health and Counseling Centers, the Fitness Center, and Library
and Technology Services. This means the student’s Lehigh email
account will be suspended and he or she will be unable to use library
services. However, the College Dean’s Office may request that the
email account and library privileges remain active during the term of
the approved leave, up to a maximum of two years.
• Funded students cease to receive stipend payments from the start of
the approved date of the leave. Students receiving funding provided
to the university by external grants or contracts should consult with
their funding-related adviser/supervisor about applicable rules,
procedures and possible limitations. While those who have provided
financial support for students who go on leave will do their best to
support those students when they return and resume their studies, it
is not possible to guarantee such support will be available when the
student returns.
• Student loans may come out of deferment and the student may be
required to begin repaying his/her loans. Please consult Financial
Aid: http://www.lehigh.edu/~infao/graduate/index.html.
• Immigration status may be affected for international students.
Please consult the Office of International Students and Scholars:
http://www.lehigh.edu/oiss/
• Students living in campus housing will need to make other living
arrangements, since only registered students in good standing are
eligible for such housing. Unfortunately, Residential Services also
cannot guarantee space upon the student’s return.
• Students enrolled in the University health insurance plan may
be able to keep their health insurance during the term of the
health insurance contract. In this case, students can contact the
University Health Center to obtain a list of primary care doctors in the
community to use during their leave of absence. Please consult the
student health insurance brochure for eligibility restrictions: https://

35

financeadmin.lehigh.edu/sites/financeadmin.lehigh.edu/files/offices/
bursar/docs/HealthInsuranceBrochure.pdf
• Students requesting a leave for medical or psychological reasons
must include documentation from their health provider which
indicates a recommendation for the leave and expected time away.
The documentation is submitted to --and is only available to-the Director of Graduate Life. Such documentation remains kept
confidential.
• Students who need to be absent within the semester (no more than
a few weeks in duration) must consult with their professors about the
possibility of making up missed classwork and, if applicable, work
related to their funding support. In these circumstances, students do
not need to submit an official Leave of Absence request. Students
may consult the Director of Graduate Student Life with questions and
concerns.
• To formally request a leave of absence, students must complete the
form at the following link: http://lehigh.edu/go/gradloa
Important Information about Involuntary Leaves of Absence:
• The University may require an involuntary leave of any student who
appears to have a serious physical, psychological or emotional
disorder which offers reasonable cause to believe he or she may
be a danger to self or others, or may disrupt proper activities of the
University community and its members, or may be unable to look
after his or her affairs adequately. An involuntary leave of absence
is included in the maximum leave of two years.
• Time-to-degree deadlines are not extended for students who are
suspended due to Code of Conduct violations.
Returning from Leave and Resuming Graduate Studies
• When ready to resume graduate study, students are required to
complete the Graduate Readmission Form, available at the following
link: http://lehigh.edu/go/gradreadmit
• Returning students are encouraged to contact their program adviser
as early as possible to discuss registration.
• Returning students may only re-enroll for a full semester or summer
session. In order to meet this requirement, such students need to be
aware of registration deadlines.
• Students who take a leave from graduate study without requesting
an official leave of absence will be required to petition the Standing
of Graduate Students (SOGS) committee for readmission if they’ve
been away from the University for more than one year. Unapproved
leaves count toward the two-year leave maximum.
If you have any questions about this policy or its application, please
contact the Director of Graduate Student Life, Kathleen Hutnik, either
by email kaha@lehigh.edu> or telephone 610-758-3648 (http://
catalog.lehigh.edu/graduatestudyandresearch/graduateleaveofabsence/
tel:610-758-3648).

Graduation
DEGREE REGISTRATION

A student must be registered in the semester in which the degree
is conferred. If a student is not registered for a course, he/she must
register for maintenance of candidacy. Candidates for September
degrees do not need to be enrolled the summer preceding the degree if
they were enrolled both fall and spring of the previous academic year.
APPLICATION FOR DEGREE

Candidates for graduation on University Day in May must file with
the registrar on or before February 1 a written notice of candidacy for
the degree; candidates for graduation in September file a notice of
candidacy on or before July 1; candidates for graduation in January file a
notice of candidacy on or before October 1.
Failure to file such notice by such dates mentioned debars the candidate
from receiving the degree at the ensuing graduation exercises. If a
petition for late filing is granted, but before deadline to complete all
requirements, a fee is assessed.
CLEARANCE

Graduate students must receive clearance from the university prior to
the awarding of the degree. The following obligations must be satisfied:

36

Tuition and Fees

• Students must complete all coursework, including any incomplete
grades they may have received.
• Theses must be cleared by the registrar’s office.
• Dissertations must be cleared by the appropriate dean’s office.
• All financial obligations must be cleared with the bursar. Tuition fees,
bookstore charges, library fines, and motor or vehicle fines must be
paid before graduation.
• All library books on loan must be returned.
• Students must turn in their student identification cards at the I.D.
card office.
The interdepartmental clearance sheet must be completed. This form
requires the signature of the student’s department chairperson (except
for the College of Education), before it is submitted to the registrar at
least three days prior to graduation.

OTHER FEES
TUITION PAYMENT

Graduate students who register at least six weeks prior to the start of
classes will receive an email notification to their Lehigh email account
that their tuition bill is ready to view online at the e-Bill Suite. Students
that register less than six weeks prior to the start of classes will most
likely not have a tuition bill generated prior to the start of classes. To
remain in good standing, tuition charges must be paid prior to the start
of classes even if the student has not received a tuition bill because of
his/her late registration for classes. Students can review their current
account balance online 24/7 by logging into the e-Bill Suite or the
Campus Portal. Information about the various payment options is
available at the Bursar’s Office web site at www.lehigh.edu/inburs/ or by
calling the Bursar’s Office.
TUITION REFUNDS

A student in good standing who formally withdraws or drops a course(s)
before 60% of the semester has been completed is eligible for a
tuition refund. Academic fees are non-refundable after the first day
of classes. The “first day of classes” is considered the first
day of the semester, not the first day a particular class meets.
Courses not following standard semester dates will have percent-ofsemester-completed refunds based on dates for that specific course.
Online courses percent-of-semester-completed are based on access
availability, not if/when student first accessed course material. No tuition
refunds will be made for courses of one week or less after the first day of
class.

Financial Aid
Financial aid is available only for regular, full-time graduate students.
Teaching assistantships, research assistantships, graduate
assistantships, fellowships, and scholarships are academic awards
made by individual academic departments. Several graduate
assistantships unrelated to a particular area of study can be obtained
by applying to administrative offices. International students are also
encouraged to apply for funding to outside sponsoring agencies and/or
home governments. Finally, please note that all student loan programs
are administered by the Office of Financial Aid located at 27 Memorial
Drive West. (Please read the section below regarding loans and workstudy.)
ACADEMIC AWARDS

Requests for fellowships, scholarships, research assistantships,
teaching assistantships, and graduate assistantships to begin in the fall
semester must be filed with academic departments no later than January
15. (Some departments have earlier deadlines.) Generally, a special
committee formed by department faculty selects the recipients of these
awards based upon merit; students are not required to submit a financial
statement.
In addition to their stipends, graduate students holding half-time teaching
appointments generally receive tuition remission. Fellowship holders
also receive a stipend and tuition award. Scholarship recipients are
awarded tuition. Research assistants receive a stipend for research
services, but their tuition is commonly paid directly by research projects.

LIVING ACCOMMODATIONS

TEACHING ASSISTANTS AND GRADUATE ASSISTANTS

The university maintains a graduate student housing complex in the
Saucon Valley that has 135 living units. This complex, Saucon Village
Apartments, provides units generally on a yearly lease basis. For the
2016-2017 period beginning in September, the following are the monthly
rents exclusive of utilities:

Teaching assistant and graduate assistant (TA/GA) are technical terms
used to describe specific types of Lehigh University graduate students.
The duties of TAs and GAs are generally set by the departments or
offices that appoint them, but certain conditions must be satisfied

Lehigh University 2016-2017

before a student can be classified as a teaching assistant or a graduate
assistant. These include:
• Each TA/GA must be a regular full-time resident Lehigh graduate
student, which normally requires registration for at least nine credit
hours per semester.
• A TA/GA is a half-time position and each TA/GA provides services to
Lehigh University of up to twenty hours per week. Quarter-time and
eighth-time TA/GA appointments are possible for full-time resident
graduate students, with stipends and tuition remission appropriately
reduced.
• Each TA/GA must be paid a specific stipend, which is set for
the academic year by the dean of the appropriate college after
consultation with the Director of Budget.
• Qualified TAs/GAs receive tuition remission for at most ten credit
hours in a regular semester. No TA/GA may register for more than
ten credit hours. A student who is a TA/GA during the preceding
academic year is entitled to at most three hours of thesis, research,
or dissertation registration (not course credit) in the following
summer without payment of tuition (except in the College of
Education).
• Each TA/GA is appointed by a process which begins with a
formal letter of appointment issued by the appropriate department
chairperson. The appointment letter specifies standard university
conditions including stipend level, time of arrival, length of service,
and the requirement of satisfactory academic progress and
performance of duties. Each department chairperson submits written
notification of TA/GA appointments to the appropriate college dean
or vice president.
The Graduate and Research Committee endorsed academic guidelines
for new teaching assistants which exceed minimum admission
requirements. Each TA should satisfy one of the following: have a GPA
of 3.0 or better in the undergraduate major field of study; have a GPA
of 3.5 in the senior year major field; rank in the 85th percentile or higher
on the Graduate Record Exam or other standardized test; or have a
GPA of 3.5 in at least twelve hours of graduate work in the major field.
Exceptions to these guidelines shall be made only with the approval of
the appropriate dean.
In addition, each teaching assistant must make normal progress toward
a graduate degree. The definition of normal progress may vary among
departments, but the criteria for satisfactory progress are established
by the department faculty and the Graduate and Research Committee.
Teaching assistants who fail to satisfy these criteria are ineligible for
reappointment.
In addition to achieving the minimum TOEFL iBT scores necessary
for admission, potential Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants
whose first language is not English who will be working with Lehigh
undergraduates in academic settings (classrooms, recitations, labs,
office hours, etc.) must pass Lehigh University’s Test of Presentation
and Speaking Skills (TOPSS) prior to beginning their instructional
responsibilities. At the Department’s discretion, students who score in
the conditional range on the TOPSS may be appointed as a TA or GA
but will be required to attend English as a Second Language courses,
re-take the TOPSS, and achieve a passing score within one semester.
Tuition remission for qualified TAs/GAs is authorized by the appropriate
dean or vice president as part of the registration process. Each college
dean or appropriate vice president will be provided tuition remission
accounts against which TA/GA remissions will be charged. The accounts
will be budgeted at an amount equal to the nine-hour TA/GA tuition rate
times the approved number of TA/GA positions and will be included
in the annual operating budget. The budgets shall not be exceeded.
If additional TA/GA positions are desired on a temporary basis, the
account executive must provide for the transfer of budget support to the
remission account. These budgets are to be used exclusively for tuition
remission for authorized TA/GA positions.
There are a limited number of summer TA/GA appointments. These TA/
GAs must receive the same monthly stipend as academic year TAs/GAs
and devote up to twenty hours per week to the GA/TA responsibilities.
A summer TA/GA registers for a maximum of three credit hours in each
summer session of appointment and receives tuition remission for that
registration.

OTHER GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS

Graduate students may apply directly to administrative offices for
graduate assistantships unrelated to their areas of study. The availability
of these assistantships is based upon the needs of the individual
departments. GAs are appointed regularly by the office of the vice
provost for student affairs, the dean of students office, the university
counseling service, and by career services.
LOANS AND WORK-STUDY AWARDS

Graduate students may apply for Federally funded loans (Direct
Unsubsidized Loan or Graduate PLUS Loan) through the Office of
Financial Aid. Federal funds are awarded using the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) which can be completed on the web at
www.fafsa.ed.gov. In addition to the FAFSA, Lehigh University requires
a university application (Graduate Student Financial Aid Application).
Applications for Federal loans cannot be processed and funds cannot be
disbursed, until the FAFSA is received and reviewed.
Eligibility for student loans is based on the number of credits to be
taken and the total amount of assistance received. Any change to
the number of credits to be taken or the amount of aid received may
affect loan eligibility. To avoid problems with your loan application, it
is important that you notify the Office of Financial Aid of any changes
in your enrollment or in the amount of aid received. It is the student’s
responsibility to notify the Office of Financial Aid of any changes.

Degree Information
The following degrees are offered by the university: the master of
arts, the master of business administration, the master of business
administration and educational leadership, the master of business
administration and engineering, the master of education, the master of
engineering, the master of science, the doctor of philosophy, the doctor
of education, and the doctor of arts.
Students pursuing multiple graduate level degrees must meet minimum
unique degree credit-hour requirement for courses taken at Lehigh. A
single master’s degree requires a minimum of 30 credits (see transfer
credit policy for any exceptions); a single doctoral degree requires a
minimum of 72 credits, or 48 for a student with a prior master’s degree.
A student seeking two master’s degrees will be required to take at least
60 credits at Lehigh, but may petition to transfer in credits towards the
first master’s degree. No credit used for a master’s degree may be
counted towards reducing the minimum requirement of 48 Lehigh credit
hours for a doctoral degree. No graduate credit may be counted towards
two graduate level degrees.
Candidates for the master’s degree have six years in which to complete
their programs. Students should confer with their advisers to be certain
that specific department and program course requirements are met. The
following requirements must be satisfied by master’s candidates in all
departments.
PROGRAM FOR THE MASTER’S DEGREE

A student’s program must include: not less than 30 credit hours of
graduate work; not less than 18 credits of 400-level coursework
(research or thesis registration counts as part of the 400-level
coursework requirement); and not less than 18 credits of coursework
in the major, of which 15 credits must be at the 400 level. Coursework
for the master’s degree must be taken under at least two instructors
and must be approved by Lehigh University. With the approval of the
department chair, between 9 and 15 credits of graduate coursework
taken elsewhere may be transferred to a Lehigh master’s program.
The number of credits that may be transferred depends on the number
of credits in the master’s program: Up to 9 credits for programs of 36
credits or less; up to 12 credits for programs of 37 to 48 credits; and up
to 15 credits for programs of 49 to 60 credits. Programs, departments
and colleges may have more restrictive transfer rules, however, and
students should consult their program offices to learn of any such
restrictions.
Course transfers require submission of completed course-transfer
petitions, with course descriptions and transcripts, as well as
departmental recommendation. Final course marks of B or better
are required, such courses may not have been applied toward any

38

Degree Information

prior degree, the courses must have been completed at an institution
accredited by one of the six regional accrediting associations, and
those courses must have been completed within four years of the first
enrollment in the Lehigh master’s program.

doctoral students spend a period of concentrated study and intellectual
association with other scholars. Two semesters of full-time Lehigh
graduate study, or 18 credit hours of Lehigh graduate study, either on or
off campus, within a fifteen-month period must be completed.

A student must complete the form, “Program for Master’s Degree,”
setting forth the courses proposed to satisfy the degree requirements.
This form should be approved by the department and then submitted
to the registrar as soon as possible after 15 credit hours toward the
degree have been completed. Approval of the program by the registrar
signifies that the student has formally been admitted to candidacy for the
master’s degree.

Individual departments may impose additional stipulations. Candidates
should check with their advisers to be certain that they have satisfied
their concentrated learning requirements.

THESIS AND COMPREHENSIVE EXAM

Candidates in some programs may be required to submit a thesis or
a report based on a research course of at least three credit hours, or
to pass a comprehensive examination given by the major department.
The department will specify which of these requirements apply and may
require both. If required, the thesis or report shall not count for more
than six credit hours, and thesis registration is limited to a maximum
of six credit hours. If the thesis or research project involves human
subjects, the student must complete the university human subjects
review packet and receive written approval from the Institutional
Review Board. All approved thesis/dissertations copies must be
submitted by the appropriate deadlines in electronic form by following
the procedures and guidelines found on the LTS Web site URL: http://
libraryguides.lehigh.edu/etd. Please contact your college dean’s office
for further clarification.
A non-thesis option exists for certain programs in the Colleges. Students
should check with their departments regarding that option.
TIME AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS

A candidate for the doctor of philosophy degree ordinarily is expected
to devote at least three academic years to graduate work. In no case is
the degree awarded to someone who has completed fewer than two full
academic years of graduate work. All post-baccalaureate work toward
the doctorate must be completed within ten years. A student beginning
doctoral coursework after an elapsed period of at least one semester
after the master’s degree has been conferred is granted seven years in
which to complete the doctoral program.
Doctoral students whose graduate study is carried out entirely at
Lehigh University must register for a minimum of 72 credits beyond
the bachelor’s degree. Students who have earned a master’s degree
at another university must register for a minimum of 48 credits. These
requirements include registration for research or dissertation credits.
Students participating in approved dual-degree doctoral programs
involving external institutions may transfer up to 25% of their total
required doctoral program research credits to Lehigh for work that was
performed at the external partner institution. Approval of such programs
is required by the dean of the relevant Lehigh college.
Full-time students working toward the doctorate normally register for
a minimum of nine credits each semester. If the minimum degree
registration requirement of 72 or 48 credits is attained prior to formal
admission to doctoral candidacy, continued registration of at least
three credits per semester is necessary. Such registration does not
automatically grant full-time student status, however. Full-time student
status must be confirmed on the graduate full-time certification form.
Students seeking to receive both a master’s degree and a doctoral
degree must complete a minimum of 72 graduate credits at Lehigh and
must meet all requirements of both degrees.
After admission to doctoral candidacy, a student must maintain
candidacy by registering at least two times each calendar year (in each
academic semester or in one academic semester and one summer
session). After completion of the minimum registration requirement, plus
any additional requirements of the student’s department or program,
students are permitted to register for ‘Maintenance of Candidacy’ and
will be charged a single credit hour of graduate tuition at the appropriate
rate for the degree program in which they are enrolled. Full-time status
must be certified on the full-time certification form each semester.
CONCENTRATED LEARNING REQUIREMENT

Each doctoral degree candidate must satisfy Lehigh’s concentrated
learning requirement. This requirement is intended to ensure that

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS

Language requirements for the Ph.D. are the option of, and in the
jurisdiction of, the candidate’s department. Since proficiency in a
language is not a university requirement, each department decides
which languages, if any, constitute part of the doctoral program.
QUALIFIERS

Many departments require students who wish to enroll in doctoral
programs to pass qualifying examinations. Since these examinations
vary among departments, students should ask their advisers or
department chairpersons for more detailed information. If a qualifying
examination is not used, students should find out how and when
eligibility to pursue doctoral studies is determined.
ADMISSION TO CANDIDACY

With the help of an academic adviser, the student names the faculty
members of the doctoral committee, a special committee formed to
guide the student through the doctoral program. The committee is
responsible for assisting the student in formulating a course of study,
satisfying specific departmental requirements, submitting a suitable
dissertation proposal and for overseeing progress in research, and
evaluating the completed dissertation. At least four faculty are appointed
to the committee; one must be a member of an outside department.
Committee membership must be approved by the university’s Graduate
and Research Committee or its designee.
A doctoral student should apply for candidacy no later than two years
after completion of the master’s degree or its equivalent and after
passing qualifying examinations, if they are required by the major
department. The prospective doctoral candidate must submit to
the doctoral committee a written program proposal that includes a
discussion of proposed dissertation research. Upon receiving committee
approval of the proposal, the candidate submits the proposal, signed
by the committee members, to the appropriate dean for action by the
Graduate and Research Committee or its designee. The dean will advise
the student of the committee’s decision.
If the dissertation research involves human subjects, all research
procedures and instruments must be approved by Lehigh University’s
Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to the involvement of the subjects.
GENERAL EXAMINATIONS

Examinations composed and administered by the members of the
student’s doctoral committee are designed to test the candidate’s
proficiency in a particular field of study. These examinations, which may
be either written or oral, should be passed at least seven months before
the degree is to be conferred. If a student fails the general examination,
a second examination may be scheduled not earlier than five months
after the first. If the results of the second examination are unsatisfactory,
no additional examination is scheduled.
DISSERTATION AND DEFENSE

The doctoral candidate is required to write a dissertation prepared
under the direction of a Lehigh University professor. The dissertation
must address a topic related to the candidate’s specialty in the major
subject, show the results of original research, provide evidence of high
scholarship, and make a significant contribution to knowledge in the
field.
Upon approval of the advising professor and, if required by the
department, secondary readers, the final draft of the dissertation is
submitted to the appropriate dean (or designee) for inspection by the
date posted in the academic calendar. Upon its return, the student
should distribute copies of the draft to the members of the doctoral
committee for review and for suggestions for revision. The candidate
then schedules a dissertation defense before the doctoral committee,
additional faculty members the department may add to the examining
committee, and the general public. After the dissertation has been
defended and revised accordingly, the student must submit the finished

Lehigh University 2016-2017

dissertation to the appropriate dean for review by the university’s
Graduate and Research Committee (or its designee) no later than
the date specified in the academic calendar for completion of all
degree requirements. All approved dissertations must be submitted
by the appropriate deadlines in electronic form by following the
procedures and guidelines found on the LTS Web site URL: http://
libraryguides.lehigh.edu/etd. Please contact your college dean’s office
for further clarification. Guidelines stipulating the standard form of the
dissertation are available in the dean’s office.

The mission of the Chemical Process Modeling and Control Research
Center at Lehigh University is to advance the theory and application
of feedback control techniques, dynamic modeling, optimization and
automation, and to apply these tools to a range of chemical and
biological systems. A key execution strategy involves close collaboration
with industrial partners to identify and solve technological relevant
automation problems.
The Center was established in January 1985 through the efforts of
faculty members of the chemical engineering department at Lehigh
University, leading industrial processing companies, the Ben Franklin
Partnership Program of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, coupled
with the organizational and financial support of the National Science
Foundation (NSF).
The center provides a unique atmosphere for fundamental research,
development of specific techniques, application to real industrial
processes, and opportunities for advanced education (M.S. and
Ph.D.) in chemical process modeling and control for academics and
industrial practitioners. Facilities are available for real time testing
of new algorithms in experimental process units, development of
dynamic simulations of real processes, and the close collaboration with
researchers in several other fields of chemical processing.
Interdisciplinary collaboration is encouraged with other research groups,
centers, or institutes engaged in biotechnology, polymer processing,
environmental science, applied statistics, signal processing, chemical
reaction engineering, and process design.
EDUCATION

An integral part of the center is the commitment to conduct an
outstanding program dedicated to the education of undergraduate and
graduate students. The center has and continues to attract top quality
students from a large group of well recognized international universities.
In addition, each year several industrial companies send employees to
receive advanced training and engage in research efforts for particular
company technical requirements.
FACULTY

The center brings together several faculty members from different
engineering disciplines in the university engaged in the research
and educational efforts of the center. Visiting faculty from other well
recognized universities supplement these researchers and provide
opportunities for diversity of thinking and innovative research. All of the
associated faculty members are recognized around the world as leaders
in their respective fields of specialization. They also serve as consultants
to a variety of industries.

Developing Urban Educational Leaders (CDUEL) (The Center for)

FACILITIES

The Center is located in Iacocca Hall on the Mountaintop Campus of
Lehigh University. This building represents a unique facility available
to the center as well as the chemical engineering department and the
Emulsion Polymers and Bioprocessing Institutes. The center has the
use of several dedicated computer facilities with numerous workstation
computers continuously available to the students, faculty, and staff.
In addition to the local computing network, the center's researchers
have access to the Lehigh University central computing facilities and its
outside links to other worldwide computing systems and data networks.
The center has several laboratories with sophisticated equipment
dedicated to process control research work.
AREAS OF RESEARCH

The research activities of the Center span a wide spectrum of problems
in large complex chemical process design, dynamical analysis and
control, as well micro and nanoscale complex process development,
evaluation, dynamical analysis and control. A recently added area of
research studies the role of feedback control in biological systems with
particular emphasis on neuronal systems encountered in neuroscience
and neurology. The research themes emphasize a combination of new
theoretical developments, new applications and translation of new
theoretical developments to practical problems.
1. Synthesis and PlantWide Control
During the last decade Center faculty have done pioneering work in
the area of plantwide control, which has resulted in the only textbook
that covers this important area. There continue to be a number of
projects in this area.
a. On Demand Control of Processes with Multiple Products: This
project studies the design and control of processes in which
consecutive reversible reactions produce multiple products.
The demand for these products can vary, so the process and
its control system must be able to produce exactly the desired
amount of each individual product. An ideal system has been
studied first in which the effect of equilibrium constants and
volatilities can be explored. A real chemical system is also being
studied (the production of methyl amines).
b. Design and Control of Tubular Reactors Systems: Adiabatic
gasphase exothermic reactions are often carried out in
tubular reactors. There are several types of systems: a single
adiabatic reactor, multiple adiabatic reactors in series with either
intermediate cooling or "cold shot" cooling (mixing some cold
feed with the hot reactor effluent) and a cooled tubular reactor.
These alternatives are being studied in terms of both steadystate
design (which has the lowest total annual cost) and dynamic
controllability (which provides the tightest temperature control in
the face of disturbances).
2. Dynamics and Control of Distillation
Reactive distillation is an emerging area in chemical engineering
because it offers potential savings in capital and energy costs
in some systems, particularly for reversible reactions. A recent
project explored several reactive distillation systems: ETBE, methyl
acetate, TAME, ethylene glycol and metathesis of pentene. The
steadystate economic designs of these systems were studied.
Then their dynamics and control were explored. Different types of
chemical systems require types of control structures. These columns
are sometimes operated using of an excess of one of the reactants
and sometimes using exact stoichiometric amounts of the two fresh
reactant feeds. Both the process design and the control scheme are
different with these two scenarios.
3. Convex Optimization Techniques in Linear and Nonlinear Process
Control
The last few years have seen the emergence of a new class of
optimization problems that have been variously referred to as a
Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), semidefinite programming (SDP)
problems and convex problems. We were one of the first groups
to explicitly show the applicability of LMIs in process control by
reformulating the modelbased predictive control (MPC) algorithms
as LMI problems. There are several classes of problems involving
control of systems subject to constraints that are amenable to LMI
formulation. These include efficient offline MPC for fast sampling
time processes, observerbased nonlinear, MPC, multimodel

transition control using MPC, antiwindup, moving horizon estimation
and evaluation of robustness, i.e., the impact of model uncertainty
on controller performance. These new control algorithms are being
tested on numerous application platforms.
4. Multi-Model and Hybrid Systems Analysis and Control
Hybrid and multimodel systems are a class of systems in which there
is interaction between continuous dynamical behavior of systems
with discrete switching behavior. For example, systems described
by piecewise linear multiple models are continuous and linear
within a prescribed region and switch to a different linear model
description in a different prescribed region of the statespace. Other
examples include switches and overrides that switch one of a family
of controllers into the closedloop, based on the operating space and
control objective.
Our research in this area has focused on two broad problems
(1) control of systems described by multiple piecewise linear
models; (2) formulation of saturated systems as switched/piecewise
linear models and subsequent antiwindup controller design using
piecewise quadratic functions. We demonstrated, through a case
study, the control of a highly nonlinear solution copolymerization
reactor using multimodel switching MPC. . We have also shown
how an appropriate antiwindup controller synthesis problem can be
formulated using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions.
5. Dynamics and Control of Micro and Nanochemical Systems
Microchemical systems are a new generation of miniature chemical
systems that carry out chemical reactions and separations in
precisely fabricated three dimensional microreactor configurations
in the size range of a few microns to a few hundred microns.
Typical microchemical systems combine fluid handling and reaction
capabilities with electronic sensing and actuation, are fabricated
using integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing techniques and use
silicon and related IC industry materials, polymers, ceramics, glass
or quartz as their material of construction.
The goal of this integrated research and education program
is to study the unique dynamical properties of such integrated
microchemical systems and to develop a framework for designing
implementable feedback control techniques for this class of
microsystems. Concepts for distributed and boundary control
theory will be employed to study the modelbased feedback control
formulation of microchemical systems and to develop a technical
framework for microsystem controller design. The Integrated
Microchemical Systems Laboratory (under the direction of Professor
M.V. Kothare) conducts this research as part of the Center.
6. Control of Biomedical Systems: We are currently working on
applying control techniques to emerging problems in biomedical
engineering, in particular, in neuroengineering. This involves
developing models of ensembles of neurons in the human brain
and use of such models in optimizing closed loop neuroprosthetic
rehabilitation strategies.

Emulsion Polymers Institute

Research support for institute activities is obtained from industrial
organizations through their membership in the Emulsion Polymers
Industrial Liaison Program as well as government agencies. Hence
some considerable effort is made to relate the research results
to industrial needs. Consequently, graduates can find excellent
opportunities for employment.

Raymond A. Pearson, Ph.D.; James E. Roberts, Ph.D.; Cesar A. Silebi,
Ph.D.; Mark A. Snyder, Ph.D.; Dmitri Vezenov, Ph.D.

Graduate students in the Institute undertake dissertation research
leading to the master of science or doctor of philosophy degree in
existing science and engineering curricula or in the Center for Polymer
Science and Engineering. Programs of study are tailored to meet
the individual needs of each student and considerable flexibility is
permitted in the selection of courses and a research topic. Educational
and research opportunities exist for postdoctoral scholars and visiting
scientists as well as resident graduate students. In addition, the institute
holds a short course each June, “Advances in Emulsion Polymerization
and Latex Technology” that typically attracts a number of industrial
participants as well as EPI students and is an excellent opportunity to
interact with industrial scientists and engineers.

Originally established in 1975, the Emulsion Polymers Institute (EPI),
provides a focus for graduate education and research in polymer
colloids. Formation of the institute constituted formal recognition of
an activity that had grown steadily since the late 1960s. Recently,
the research thrust of the Institute has been broadened to include
engineered particles . The new focus is rooted in fundamental
scientific-based particle design, but guided by identified applications,
while still maintaining a core competency in emulsion polymerization.
The rapidly broadening applications for particle technologies in fields
such as biotechnology (e.g., drug delivery, imaging, assembly of
biocompatible scaffolds), nanotechnology (e.g., directed assembly of
hierarchically ordered, functional structures), and others demand a
concomitant diversification of the institute to include a broader class of
particles: polymeric, inorganic, hybrid, macroionic, metallic, as well as
novel particulate composites designed at the nanoscale that will span all
industrially-relevant scales.
The institute has close ties with polymer and surface scientists in
the Center for Polymer Science and Engineering (CPSE), Center for
Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology (CAMN), and the departments
of chemical engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials science and
engineering. These ties reflect the interdisciplinary nature of research
that is carried out in the Institute.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

Fundamental particle research in the institute spans particle synthesis,
particle functionalization, and directed assembly of particles into higher
order, functional structures. Continuing emulsion polymers research
is a blend of theoretical and experimental problems related to the
preparation, characterization, and applications of polymer latexes and
are aimed at understanding the kinetics, mechanisms, morphology,
and the colloidal, surface and bulk of the latexes. Applications of this
fundamental technology, resulting from interdisciplinary research
among the faculty associated with the institute, stand to align well
with the strategic university and college-level nanotechnology,
biotechnology, and energy/environment initiatives. Many projects within
EPI achieve what has been the largest obstacle to commercialization
of nanotechnology: scalable process design of nanoscale functioning
materials. Materials fabricated by EPI researchers are designed to
function either as nano- or microscale sensors, material modifiers, or to
self-assemble into advanced materials that depend on the nanoscale
features of its constituents. In addition, engineered particle technologies
developed at EPI and other institutions have allowed for the validation of
soft condensed matter theories at scales available to experimentalists. In
the biotechnology area, research focuses on diagnostic and therapeutic
technology to prepare particles that are biocompatible, biologically
specific, easily detectable, and responsive to external controls. In the
area of energy, work focuses on a variety of different unique particle
technologies that may be used in applications such as catalysis and
photocatalysts for the hydrogen economy, photovoltaics and solar cells,
and membrane separations. In the environmental area, in addition
to seeking novel particle technology for contaminant remediation in
water, tailor-made colloidal particles with desirable surface properties,
should provide model systems for fundamental insight into surface
phenomena, relationships between bacterial adhesion to a surface
and cellular bioenergetics, and bacterial transport through unsaturated
porous media. Similarly, model porous media constructed by engineered
particles could benefit research on the sources, fate and transport
of bacteria in the environment, new water treatment technologies for
developing countries, and alternative water disinfection technologies.

the environment. The Center brings together faculty and professional
staff within Lehigh University to conduct research, foster partnerships
between government and industry, provide funding, research and
educational opportunities to university graduate and undergraduate
students, and promote international research collaboration. Originally
founded in 1972 as the Task Force for Energy Research, the Center was
organized into its present form in 1978.
ENERGY RESEARCH

Research within the Center falls into five major categories. Projects of
interest include:
Energy Conversion/Power Generation

This research program area has several components. The largest
focuses on the equipment and processes used in large fossil-fired
electric power plants, with research on methods of improving power
plant conversion efficiency, of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide
and of other gaseous pollutants, and of reducing the cost of generating
electricity. A second group of projects deals with fusion energy, with
an emphasis on the physics of magnetic plasma containment in fusion
reactors. Other projects deal with topics such as fuel cell conversion
systems, hydrogen production, capture of carbon dioxide, and reduction
of fresh water requirements for power plant cooling.
Energy-Related Environmental Research

The Center’s environmental research program deals with air pollution,
solid waste, and ground water contamination issues resulting from
power generation and energy conversion activities; and reduction of
amounts of fresh water required for power plant cooling.

Energy-Related Materials Research

This focus area considers materials issues in the energy field. Examples
include high temperature coatings for boiler tubes, welding processes for
new alloys, containment vessels for nuclear waste materials, component
life prediction, and development of catalysts for pollution control. Energy
Conservation and Renewable Energy. The Center’s research program
in energy conservation deals with reducing energy use in manufacturing
and with the development of high efficiency electric motors. Renewable
energy research focuses on utilization of biomass materials as fuels.
Basic Energy Sciences

Faculty and students in engineering and science also carry out research
to improve our understanding of the basic phenomena that underlie
the knowledge base required for developing new and improved energy
technologies.
Educational Opportunities

The Center’s research programs provide opportunities for graduate
students interested in working in the energy area. Most of the
departments in the College of Engineering and Applied Science, as well
as several departments within the College of Arts and Sciences, are
active in energy research and offer both masters and doctoral degree
programs suitable for studies of energy-related topics.
All degrees are granted by the academic departments and graduate
students interested in energy enroll in traditional graduate degree
programs in departments of their choice. These students specialize in
energy by complementing their programs with a selection of energyrelated courses. They pursue their graduate research in energy areas
under the supervision of faculty from the Energy Research Center or
from other research centers or academic departments.
Financial support for graduate students is available through fellowships
and research assistantships.
OUTREACH AND INDUSTRIAL LIAISON ACTIVITIES

The Center’s Energy Liaison Program is a mechanism for providing
consulting and problem-solving to member companies. The Liaison
Program also provides opportunities for involving industry in sponsored
research projects.

discovering new methods for collaboration among academic, industry
and government partners through the use of advanced technology.
Emphasis is given to innovative systems approaches to problemsolving. Operating as one of the centers in the P.C. Rossin College
of Engineering and Applied Science, the ESC is housed in Mohler
Laboratory. The Enterprise Systems Center provides undergraduate
and graduate students from all four colleges with the opportunity
to work on teams with faculty and industry professionals to solve a
variety of real world problems. Participation in these work teams, with
ESC’s unique layered mentoring, provides students with a level of
work experience representative of what they will encounter following
graduation. This is often a critical factor in winning highly competitive
employment positions. Since its inception, ESC has completed more
than 1000 projects with industry and government partners. Over 3000
undergraduate and graduate students have benefited from experiential

learning and leadership development through involvement with the
Enterprise systems Center.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The ESC conducts research into the development and implementation
of enterprise strategies to improve the effectiveness of organizations.
This research involves the utilization of systems thinking, information
technology, and leadership approaches that add value to engineering
education. In its applied research efforts, the Center focuses on
analytics techniques, operational improvements, enterprise resource
optimization, sustainable manufacturing and product development
or enhancement. Operational improvement research with partner
companies has included the development of decision support systems,
processes for workflow analysis and facility reorganization, analysis
of constraints and throughput improvement, evaluating sustainable
manufacturing opportunities, agile business practices, utilization of
analytics tools and creating new solutions for supply chain management.
Work in enterprise resource optimization has included methodologies
for business process reengineering and for the analysis and selection
of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Applied research
in product development and enhancement has included the use of
computer modeling and simulation along with analysis and evaluation
of existing products, and design for manufacturability and assembly
support.
Involvement in these applied research activities with industry partners
provides Lehigh students with hands on learning experiences built on
progressive responsibility and contribution to high impact company
projects. From these activities, students gain leadership skills and
valuable industry experience.
The creation of technology-enabled educational resources augments
traditional learning models. Coupled with knowledge management
technology, these resources create integrated learning experiences
and materials to support engineering courses. The ultimate objective
is to identify key components of innovative behavior and develop the
educational methods necessary to transfer to students the skills and
experiences that will prepare them for leadership roles in society.
The Enterprise Systems Center houses laboratories and initiatives
that enhance the overall center mission stated as follows: “The ESC
is committed to helping students learn, while simultaneously providing
value for our clients. We believe that our research should be driven by
industry needs and enabled by close partnerships and collaboration.”
The newly established ESC Advanced Analytics Laboratory provides
increased workspace and resources for industry projects and research
programs. The laboratory supports a program structure designed
to increase awareness, understanding and implementation skill
development of a broad spectrum of analytics tools and techniques.
Within the ESC is the Learning Collaboratory, an innovative educational
environment designed to promote inquiry-based and competency-driven
experiential learning. It enriches the classroom lectures with practical
experience through industry partner interactions. The Collaboratory
supports team learning, action learning, and the application of
technology to augment traditional educational resources.

The humanities consider how we understand and record human
experiences. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines including
philosophy, history, literature, religion, visual arts, music, and language,
humanistic study teaches us how to think creatively and critically about
our own identities and our connections to others—whether they live
across the street or across the world, whether they lived long ago or
will live in the futures we imagine. The Humanities Center at Lehigh
University is thus vital for building community both on and beyond our
campus. The Humanities Center creates interdisciplinary intellectual
opportunities for students, faculty, and staff engaged in humanistic
inquiry across departments and programs. Through speaker series,
reading groups, conferences, an undergraduate research journal,
research grants, and informal gatherings, the Humanities Center fosters
a broad community rooted in vibrant, rigorous, and creative inquiry into
what it means and has meant to be human. The Humanities Center
hosts an annual speaker series on a theme, bringing scholars, writers,
artists, and activists to speak on a single issue. Recent themes have
included Home, Movement, Contagion, Speaking Bodies, and the
Posthumanities.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The Center for Global Islamic Studies (CGIS) is an intellectual
community committed to the interdisciplinary study of Islamic civilization.
The Center was established at Lehigh in 2009 with the generous
support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Cutting across numerous
academic disciplines and departments, CGIS supports the academic
exploration of the diverse cultures and rich historical legacy of the
Muslim world—from its roots in Abrahamic prophecy and Greek
philosophy, to its long interaction with the West and profound impact on
global culture, trade, art and architecture, literature, politics, philosophy,
science and religious life, from Morocco to Malaysia to Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.
CGIS promotes teaching and research designed to take Islamic Studies
into and beyond the classroom by offering students, faculty and the
broader community a variety of forums for dialogue, debate and
experiential learning. The Center's intellectual core is distinguished by
three distinct signatures:
• an integrated undergraduate academic program that provides
Lehigh students with multiple outlets to encounter the diversity and
dynamism of global Islam
• a comparative, interdisciplinary approach to Islamic studies that goes
beyond narrow geographic areas and political issues to explore the
broader landscape of Islamic civilization, both past and present
• the translation of theory into practice, linking rigorous scholarship on
the Muslim world to direct, practical, hands-on learning beyond the
boundaries of the Lehigh campus
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

With seed funding from the Mellon Foundation and ongoing support
from the Provost's Office, CGIS promotes faculty and student research
projects in interdisciplinary, comparative Islamic Studies.
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

The launch of the Center for Global Islamic Studies is a pivotal
component in the continued expansion of the undergraduate educational
experience at Lehigh University. Drawing on the university's experience
in building interdisciplinary programs, its institutional commitment to
international education, and its substantive relationships with numerous
Muslim partners both in the Lehigh Valley and internationally, the Center
for Global Islamic Studies plays a central role in the university's mission
to provide Lehigh's students with transformative learning experiences
that cross academic disciplines and broaden horizons on today's
globalized world.

The Humanities Center fosters interdisciplinary research activity in
several ways. Faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates may
apply for funding to support reading groups, colloquia, conferences and
visiting speakers. Graduate students may apply for modest financial
support to enable them to travel to present research at academic
conferences. The center sponsors a works-in-progress series, which
fosters dialogue about ongoing research projects in the humanities.
Summer, Individual and Collaborative Research Grants are available for
faculty and graduate students. The objective of these grants is twofold:
1. to strengthen the intellectual community of Lehigh’s scholars in the
Humanities and
2. to provide support for faculty to pursue a humanistic research
project or creative activity and for graduate students to finish their
dissertations.
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

The Humanities Center hosts and sponsors the production of the Lehigh
Review, an undergraduate research journal founded in 1992 by the
Lehigh humanities faculty. Original articles range in topic and subject
across the spectrum of undergraduate study, from English to Economics
and Physics. Published annually, the entire publication process—from
reviewing submissions to editing to design and illustration—is handled
almost exclusively by undergraduate students and supervised by a
graduate student instructor. The Humanities Center also hosts a wide
range of informal activities to create a lively, unstructured humanistic
community.

Interactivism is a philosophical and theoretical approach to
modeling multiple biological, mental, and social phenomena. It
is attracting interest from scholars and researchers around the
world. For a general description, see: http://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/
InteractivismManifesto.pdf
The primary functions of the Institute for Interactivist Studies are:
1. to build on the growing interest in the model,
2. to promote interactivist research,
3. to give Lehigh greater visibility within this wider community of people
involved in the interactivist research program.

46

International Materials Institute for New Functionality in Glass

The primary focus of the Institute is the sponsoring of Summer Institutes
on Interactivism. These are being held biennially, and the tradition is
to alternate between North America and Europe for location. We have
organized eight International Summer Institutes: 2001 at Lehigh; 2003
in Copenhagen; 2005 at Clemson University; 2007 in Paris; 2009 in
Vancouver; 2011 in Syros, Greece; 2013 at the University of South
Florida in Tampa, FL; and 2015 at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
These have attracted philosophers, psychologists, biologists, roboticists,
and linguists from more than twenty countries. ISI 2017 is planned for
Ohrid, Macedonia.
The Institute also:
1. sponsors the Interactivist Forum, an email discussion group which
currently has about 140 members from some 25 countries,
2. sponsors an institute web site — http://www.lehigh.edu/~interact/
index.html,
3. encourages and sponsors visiting scholars,
4. participates in contributing to the journal New Ideas in Psychology,
published by Elsevier, and
5. encourages collaborative work — we currently have about half a
dozen publications co-authored by institute affiliates, and special
issues on Interactivism in two journals are in press or planned.

7 Asa Drive. 758-4217. www.lehigh.edu/imi
Himanshu Jain, Eng.Sc.D., Director
Lehigh’s International Materials Institute for New Functionality in
Glass (IMI-NFG) was founded in 2004 on a program by the same
name and sponsored by the National Science Foundation under
an initiative to advance materials research globally by enhancing
coordinated international collaboration between U.S. researchers and
educators and their counterparts worldwide. The Institute’s long term
goal is the creation of a worldwide network in glass research for new
applications, and the development of a new generation of scientists
and engineers with enhanced international leadership capabilities.
Specifically on campus, it promotes new activities in glass research
through international and national collaborations, and the development
of new approaches to the education of glass. Faculty and students from
various Departments of Rossin College of Engineering and Applied
Science, and College of Arts and Sciences participate in its activities
listed below.
Half of the 20 most significant inventions of the 20th century, as
identified by the National Academy of Engineering, would not have
materialized without glass. The solutions to 12 of the 14 grand
engineering challenges of this century depend on the availability
of glass either as a support material or as an active component for
sensing, information storage, treatment delivery, etc. The discovery
of new phenomena, along with continually improving properties and
processing methods, will keep glass at the cutting-edge of technology.
Unfortunately, in recent decades glass education has fragmented
with the result that a larger number of students is exposed to glassy
materials, but with relatively shallow, cursory knowledge that does not
prepare them to become a professional glass scientist or engineer.
To meet these challenges IMI-NFG is pooling together resources of
educational institutions, leading glass companies, national laboratories
and professional organizations from across the globe. Thus, it is
promoting research through synergistic collaborations and international
exchange of researchers at undergraduate to faculty level as well
as training glass professionals through internet and other education
technology to create a new generation of scientists and engineers with
enhanced leadership capabilities.
To promote international research collaborations for new uses of glass,
and to make glass education available without geographical boundaries,
IMI-NFG sponsors and provides support for the following programs:

INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE PROGRAM

International Research Exchange Program, which is available to Lehigh
faculty, postdocs, graduate students to establish collaborations with
colleagues abroad. This opportunity can be catalytic to building new
international teams of complimentary expertise. It has supported
numerous short and long term visitors to Lehigh campus, including
sabbatical stay of professors from abroad who have taught courses and
lectured at Lehigh, and developed new multinational research teams.
GLASS EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL

Development of Educational Material such as video DVDs and hands-on
demonstrations by the leading international glass experts to promote the
understanding of glass at all levels. A variety of over 300 video tutorial
lectures and overviews of the latest progress is available via Internet
to interested students without charge. For example, a full semester
course on Optical and Photonic Glasses consisting of 39 lectures is
accessible from IMI-NFG’s web site. The teachers at Lehigh and other
universities and colleges will find this collection a useful resource for
their lectures. Professionals in industry can learn the subject by studying
these lectures.

The Lawrence Henry Gipson Institute for Eighteenth-Century Studies
was established in 1971, to honor one of America’s most distinguished
scholars, who served as a long-time member of the faculty at Lehigh.
Gipson’s monumental life work, The British Empire Before the American
Revolution (15 volumes) was written between 1936 and 1970. Gipson
received the Pulitzer Prize in History in 1962 for Volume 10, subtitled,
The Great War For Empire. When he died in 1971, Professor Gipson left
his entire estate to Lehigh and provided the original endowment for the
institute.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The income from the endowment of the institute is used to encourage
faculty and student research in the eighteenth century by providing
grants to defray travel costs, copying, and other expenses to permit
scholars to visit necessary libraries and depositories. The Gipson
Institute normally awards one fellowship annually to a Ph.D. candidate
enrolled at Lehigh University for dissertation research and writing in
any field of eighteenth-century studies. The institute also helps provide
additional resources to build the university library's research collections
in eighteenth-century studies.
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

The institute invites leading scholars to give lectures and supports
relevant programs such as interdisciplinary seminars and visiting
scholars interested in the eighteenth century. Occasional symposia
honor Professor Gipson by bringing to campus distinguished scholars
to lecture and discuss various topics. The essays generated at the
symposia have been published and the institute maintains a continuing
close relationship with Lehigh University Press for publishing original
manuscripts on the eighteenth century.

The Center for Promoting Research to Practice seeks to develop
practical solutions to real problems for those individuals at risk or
who have disabilities. All too often research that is created for these
individuals remains at the development level and is not disseminated
into best practices. Using an interdisciplinary approach and establishing
a living laboratory through partnerships with schools, parent and
families, and community service and support providers, the Center
aspires to distinguish itself as a leader at state, regional, and national
levels in addressing the need for the production of research to reach
the users and consumers of research. The mission of the Center for
Promoting Research to Practice (CPRP) is to generate new knowledge
that will favorably impact the lives of individuals with or at risk for
disabilities and promote the use of evidence based best practices
by schools, families, and community service providers. The Center
emphasizes the conducting of applied research, partnership, and
dissemination.
APPLIED RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES

The CPRP focuses on securing research projects that emphasize
bringing research findings from the field and moving them into effective
practice with evaluation of outcomes. The projects secured by the CPRP
faculty focus on individuals who have identified areas of disability or are
considered at risk for developing disabilities. Currently, the Center has
research projects examining the most effective intervention strategies
for improving behavioral and academic outcomes for students with
behavior disorders. One project focuses on understanding effective,
scientifically based interventions in educating students who present
severe challenges to the schools. Included in the Center is a research
project that aims to develop and integrate Little Talks, an intervention to
bolster language and literacy among low-income infants and toddlers,
in home-based early intervention. Additionally, two projects focus
on supporting the language and literacy development of preschool
children with language impairment, a population of children who are
at risk for developing reading disorders in school-age years. A few
completed projects include the implementation and evaluation of
progress monitoring within a Response to Intervention model of schoolwide change in six high need elementary schools in two diverse school
districts, evaluation of the Philadelphia home-school visitor model for
infants and toddlers, and a project focused on the evaluation of the Early
Reading First initiative to improve early literacy in Head Start preschool
children.
PARTNERSHIP

The Center forms and maintains partnerships at national, regional,
and local levels. Several objectives are established to accomplish this
goal. The CPRP assists with the development and implementation of
research projects designed in local school districts and intermediate
units, as well as early childhood education and intervention providers.

Value Chain Research (Center for)

Many school districts, particularly small and rural districts, do not have
the capacity to engage in widescale research efforts. Yet, these districts
often have very significant needs for empirically based decision making.
The CPRP provides a cost effective vehicle for these districts to engage
in such research efforts. Another level of partnership for the CPRP
is interdisciplinary research within the University community. This
objective is met through facilitating cross- college and cross-program
proposals. Continuous efforts are made to invite colleagues from across
departments and colleges in the University to join with faculty in the
College of Education in pursuing research interests that are within the
mission of the Center. Efforts also continue to conduct research with
colleagues across institutions. Projects have included partner institutions
such as Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Ohio University, the Ohio
State University, Oregon Research Institution, Temple University,
Teachers College, University of Missouri, University of NebraskaLincoln, University of Pittsburgh, American Institutes for Research, Utah
State University, and Inspired Learning, LC, in Allentown.
DISSEMINATION

The CPRP is a resource for distilling and bringing research findings
to the field. Investigators conducting research have published the
outcomes of findings in professional journals and outlets. In addition,
the CPRP initiates dissemination to parents, teachers, and other
practitioners in a format that more easily affects practice.
The Center's mission, goals, current accomplishments, as well as its
future initiatives are disseminated to groups both on- and off-campus.
Included in its objectives are the development of publicity about the
Center itself and outcomes of Center projects through varied forms
of communication across campus as well as institutions of higher
education, local/state educational agencies, community agencies, and
parent groups.

The Center for Manufacturing Systems Engineering was created in
response to the expressed needs of industry for educational and
research services which were distinctively cross-disciplinary. A
primary responsibility of the center is the administration of an award
winning educational program leading to a Master of Science degree
in Manufacturing Systems Engineering. This world renowned program
started in January of 1984 as a result of a major initiation grant from the
IBM Corporation. It now has 413 alumni who are working as managers
and technical leaders in industry around the world. The center has four
major thrusts:
1. A graduate program which offers a curriculum leading to the Master
of Science degree in MSE.
2. Research directed at solving problems of manufacturing; this also
serves to maintain faculty currency and provides a vehicle for
student project and thesis studies.
3. Technology transfer to sustain the free flow of knowledge from the
research laboratories to industrial applications, and from leading
edge member industries back into the classrooms.
4. The provision of service by supporting conferences, clinics,
workshops and other means for communicating and disseminating
the advantages of sound manufacturing systems engineering
practice.

Graduate Education

The 30-credit master's degree MSE program is cross-disciplinary,
administered through the College of Engineering and Applied Science,
with additional courses provided by the College of Business and
Economics. Four core courses, 4-5 graduate level elective courses
(at least one elective must be an MSE-numbered course), and a 3 or
6 credit research project or thesis are requirements of all candidates
for the M.S. degree. Courses are offered on campus and scheduled
so that part-time students can complete the degree in two years. It is
possible for distance students to earn the MS in MSE degree remotely.
Special activities in the program are team intensive and include in depth
studies of companies, tours of industry, industry-related research and
internships. Additionally, an MSE option is available in the MBA&E
program.
Research Activities

Students in the MS in MSE program undertake research of interest
either to their employers, or to industry in general. Research activities
range from additive manufacturing, microelectronics packaging,
the use of lead free solders, welding specifications, pharmaceutical
industry processes and equipment development qualification, design
management, and process development for surgical products. There
are investigations into activity-based costing, design management,
application of financial information systems, and injection molding. There

Packer, associate dean.
The College of Arts and Sciences is the heart of Lehigh University
offering a wide variety of academic majors, minors and programs,
while also providing essential liberal arts access to all Lehigh
students. Arts and Science faculty are engaged as active scholars,
are highly accessible, and are committed to the teaching mission of
our undergraduate programs. A hallmark of our college is the faculty’s
ability to engage students interactively and experientially in research and
scholarship.
Students in the College develop new habits of mind that characterize
the liberal arts education, such as testing assumptions, respecting
evidence, and probing the unknown with curiosity and an open mind.
Those habits prepare our graduates to thrive in an uncertain world.
Through a combination of college-wide distribution requirements and
major field requirements, Lehigh Arts and Sciences students investigate
and acquire knowledge of human cultures and the physical and natural
world by studying arts and humanities, mathematics, natural sciences,
and social sciences.
Studying broadly in the areas above and concentrating deeply in a major
field will help develop intellectual traits and skills needed to create the
lifelong learning habits necessary to confront constantly changing social
conditions, emerging technologies, careers and lives.
The College of Arts and Sciences offers several curricular options:
• A four-year arts and sciences curriculum leading to a bachelor of arts
or bachelor of science degree in designated fields
• A five-year arts-engineering curriculum leading to a bachelor’s
degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a bachelor of
science degree from the College of Engineering and Applied Science
• Dual degree programs within the college and in conjunction with the
other two undergraduate colleges.
TEACHER PREPARATION

• A five-year program leading to a bachelor’s degree from the College
of Arts and Sciences and a master’s degree in Education from the
College of Education
MAJOR DEGREE PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE
Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science Degree Programs

Two distinct bachelor-degree programs are offered by the College, each
distinguished mainly by the proportion of courses taken in the major
field. For the Bachelor of Arts degree the student takes a comparatively
smaller number of courses to fulfill the major requirements plus a
selection of courses in various fields outside the major. For the more
professionally oriented Bachelor of Science degree, offered by the
College in designated disciplines, the student takes a more extensive
concentration in the major field, along with a proportionally smaller
number of courses outside the major. Except for this distinction, the
same basic requirements must be met for both degree programs
(including the minimum number of 120 hours for graduation and the
minimum average in the major of 2.0). No more than six hours of military
science may be applied toward either degree.

Mathematics and Natural Science

Astronomy, behavioral neuroscience, biology, chemistry, computer
science, earth and environmental science, mathematics, molecular
biology, physics
BA degrees in predental science, premedical science, or preoptometry
science are available to students who are admitted to certain combined
degree programs (see Health Professions Programs).
Bachelor of Science Degree

Astrophysics, behavioral neuroscience, biochemistry, biology, chemistry,
computer science, earth and environmental science, mathematics,
molecular biology, pharmaceutical chemistry, physics, psychology,
statistics
GENERAL PLAN OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDY

Students in the College are required to choose - usually by the end
of the sophomore year - a major field and to complete a program of
courses, selected in consultation with the student’s advisor, to provide
the breadth that is the mark of a liberal education. For most students,
the credits earned for the major and those earned for the distribution
requirements are not enough to meet the graduation requirement of 120,
and students take free elective courses in areas of interest to earn the
remaining credits. Three schemes of courses - one in the student’s area
of concentration (the major-field requirements), a second set drawn from
certain designated disciplines (the distribution requirements representing
the minimum set), and a third set without constraints (the free electives)
- make up the educational program in the College.
Major Field of Concentration

By majoring in a specific discipline a student establishes a foundation
of knowledge in that field and starts to apply its traditional body of
knowledge. By submitting to increasingly challenging and complex
exercises in a distinct discipline over several semesters and under
the guidance of mature practitioners, the student can start to feel the
rewards of intellectual mastery of a subject. The student thus develops
expertise and intellectual sophistication.
Along with introductory courses in the discipline, the minimum number of
credits for the major is 30. The student must maintain a minimum gradepoint average of 2.0 in the major field.
Standard major sequences

When a student chooses one of the standard majors, a faculty member
from the department or program offering the major becomes a student’s
major advisor and assists the student in constructing a program of study.
In all cases, the final responsibility for meeting both major and non-major
requirements rests with the student.
Special interdisciplinary majors

In addition to the standard major programs, specially structured
interdisciplinary major sequences between majors are possible. For
example, a student interested in a professional school of urban or
regional planning might wish to structure a special major consisting
primarily of courses in political science and economics or in economics
and social relations.
Any student may, with the aid of faculty members chosen from the
disciplines involved, devise an interdisciplinary major program to include
no less than thirty credits of related course work, of which at least 15

54

College of Arts and Sciences

credits must consist of advanced courses. The major advisors and the
dean of the college must approve the program.

Chosen from those designated in: architecture, art, classics,
history, modern languages and literature, English, music,
philosophy, religion studies, and theatre.

Multiple majors and Dual degrees

A student who wishes to fulfill the requirements for more than one major
program has two options. A double major is a single BA degree with
two majors (some students complete triple majors). A student pursues
a double major by declaring both majors. Typically, double majors can
be completed in four years, but sequencing of courses and time conflicts
with required courses can introduce delays. No more than three courses
may overlap two majors.
A dual degree program is a combined BA and BS program or two
Bachelor of Science degrees in one or more of our undergraduate
colleges. The BA is in the College of Arts and Sciences, and the BS may
be in any one of the three undergraduate colleges. A student pursues
a dual degree by declaring the first program and then petitioning the
Standing of Students Committee for permission to pursue the second
degree program. A semester-by-semester plan and a major declaration
for the second degree must accompany the petition to pursue a dual
degree. The dual-degree student must satisfy major and distribution
requirements for both degrees and earn a minimum of 30 additional
credits beyond those required for the first degree. All of the 30 additional
credits must be taken at Lehigh or in Lehigh residency programs.
The requirement of 30 additional credits typically makes the dual
degree program a five-year program. There is no limit on the number of
overlapping courses between two degrees, but there must be at least
30 credits of non-overlapping coursework in each degree program. For
administrative purposes, students who take two degrees or two majors
must designate one as the primary major or primary degree.
Distribution Requirements

Whatever expertise in a single discipline an undergraduate may achieve,
curiosity lures most of us beyond the confines of a single chosen
specialty. Furthermore, in a swiftly changing world, careers are being
rapidly redefined and only a person of broad intellectual mindset can
consider where their talents may be most useful to society. Many
of the basic modes of thought and work in various fields are being
reformulated, often producing surprising influences in the public and
private spheres. To develop a satisfying professional life and be a
responsible citizen of our increasingly global world, one needs exposure
to the concepts and methods of a variety of disciplines.
The distribution requirements draw upon four primary domains of
learning. The faculty believe exposure to these broad areas will
help students develop a basic understanding of the various forms of
knowledge generated in these fields. Specific credit hours are required
in each of the following four domains: arts and humanities, mathematics,
natural sciences, and social sciences.
Distribution Requirements for the B.A. and the B.S.

Students and advisors should monitor closely the progress toward completion
of requirements. Courses taken to satisfy a major program may be used to
satisfy distribution requirements in only one distribution area.

Total required for graduation: 120 credits
A student’s program, including the choice of distribution requirements, is
not official until approved by the advisor.
ECKARDT SCHOLARS PROGRAM

The Eckardt Scholars Program is a highly selective and unique
honors program in the College of Arts and Sciences. The program
prioritizes intellectual curiosity, independent work, and close mentoring
relationships between students and faculty. Each incoming class
includes approximately twenty Eckardt Scholars. These students receive
unique academic privileges that provide them with great opportunities
at Lehigh and beyond. Students in the program are exempt from the
Arts & Sciences distribution requirements and work with their major
advisor and the Eckardt Scholars Program Director to create a flexible
course of study that best suits their academic interests and ambitions.
Although exempt from distribution requirements, students will complete
the requisite number of credits for their degrees and all correlative
requirements for their majors. The program includes participation in two
Eckardt Scholar Seminars and completion of a large independent project
(e.g., a thesis, artistic creation, or other capstone experience) during the
senior year.
Participation in the Eckardt Scholars Program is restricted to only the
most well-qualified students. Some students may be invited to enroll
at the time of admission to the university while others are identified by
faculty and encouraged to apply during their first few semesters. Those
admitted to the program are selected on the basis of their academic
records, written statements of educational goals, and at least two faculty
recommendations.
In addition to the academic privileges of the program, Eckardt Scholars
are offered an array of special opportunities, such as close mentoring,
invitations to special events, funding for research projects, career
advising, etc.
JUNIOR-YEAR WRITING CERTIFICATION

The faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences value writing as an
essential tool for learning. Writing well is indispensable for performing
responsibly in any profession and in most areas of life. Beyond the two
English courses required in the first year, students are encouraged to
take courses that provide continued practice in writing. In particular,
each student must complete at least one “writing-intensive” course,
normally during their junior year. Some major programs require the
writing-intensive course be taken in the major field, while others
allow it to be chosen freely from writing-intensive courses offered
by any department or program. Courses that satisfy the writingintensive requirement may also be used to fulfill major or distribution
requirements. Please note: only courses designated as "WI" in the
course catalog or select independent studies may be used to fulfill this
requirement.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY

8

Students planning to pursue graduate study toward a doctorate are
reminded that most graduate schools require doctoral candidates to
demonstrate a reading knowledge of one or two foreign languages.
Proficiency in foreign languages is advantageous for careers in law,
government, journalism, commerce, industry and other fields.
INTERNSHIPS

8

Many departments and programs offer credit for internship experiences.
Students should consult with their home department for information
on arranging internships. The University faculty has established three
important criteria that must be met by all internships: 80 hours of
work are required for each credit awarded, no credit can be awarded
for an internship ex post facto, and the student must register for the
internship course during the same term that the internship work is
actually conducted. Students should be sure to pre-arrange all internship
experiences with the appropriate department. Internship credits

Lehigh University 2016-2017

cannot be awarded for work experiences without a distinct educational
component. A memorandum of understanding circulated among the
employer, student, and departmental internship course director helps
to promote a common understanding of the educational and work
objectives of the internship. Students are advised that not all work
experiences advertised as “internships” warrant academic credit, even
though they may be otherwise worthwhile.
MINOR PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE

Certain departments, divisions, and programs in the College of Arts
and Sciences afford an opportunity to minor in an additional field of
concentration other than the major field.
A minor consists of at least 15 credits; the specific content is determined
by the department, division, or program concerned. A minor is optional
and, if successfully completed, will be shown on the university
transcript in the same manner as the major field. A 2.0 minimum gradepoint average is required for courses in the minor. Because of this
requirement, no course in the minor program may be taken with Pass/
Fail grading. No more than one course may be double-counted toward a
major and a minor, and no more than one course may overlap between
two minors.
Minors in the College of Arts and Sciences departments and programs
are available for degree candidates in other colleges within the
university, with approval of their college advisor.
The following are established minors in the College of Arts and
Sciences. Some minor-program descriptions are collected within
departmental descriptions, or located elsewhere, as indicated by
parentheses. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may also
complete a minor in Business through the Business College or an
Engineering minor through the College of Engineering.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR PROGRAM

During the first year, every student in the College of Arts and Sciences
is required to enroll in a First-Year Seminar. College seminars provide
an intimate and supportive environment that facilitates the transition to
university life. Within the seminar students develop skills that serve as
a framework for their future scholarly work – how to read closely, think
critically, write clearly, learn cooperatively, speak persuasively, and
solve problems creatively.
Courses in this program are an excellent way to explore a subject
that may be new, or to enter more deeply into an area of previous
interest. Whatever the topic, FYSs emphasize reading assignments,
papers, and oral presentations, while others include tests, laboratory
work, or fieldwork.
PRE-LAW PROGRAMS

Lehigh has a strong pre-law tradition. In keeping with the policy of
the Association of American Law Schools, the university does not
have a prescribed pre-law curriculum. Successful candidates for law
school demonstrate skills in critical analysis, logical reasoning, and
communication and have pursued rigorous coursework of significant
breadth and depth. Lehigh students have attained entrance to law
schools from diverse curricula in all three of the undergraduate colleges.
Specifically law-related courses are offered in the College of Arts and
Sciences (e.g. Constitutional Law and Politics, Civil Rights and Civil
Liberties, Law and Order) and the College of Business and Economics
(e.g., Introduction to Law and Legal Environment of Business).
In addition to formal academic instruction, Lehigh provides other
opportunities for learning about the law and legal careers. The annual
Tresolini Lecture series brings nationally recognized speakers to
campus for extended interactions with faculty and students. Tresolini
lecturers have included present and past U.S. and state Supreme Court
justices and renowned legal scholars and practitioners. Lehigh also
provides opportunities for gaining academic credit in several off-campus
programs that provide practical experience in law and public affairs.
Advising is available to prospective pre-law students on a continuous
basis from first-year orientation through the law school application
process in the senior year. The pre-professional advisor in the Center

56

College of Arts and Sciences

for Career and Professional Development coordinates these pre-law
counseling services.
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS

Schools of medicine, dentistry, optometry, podiatry, and veterinary
medicine stress the importance of a strong liberal arts education as
well as prescribed studies in the sciences. Although most pre-health
students will choose a major in a pure or applied science, as long as
candidates have the essential courses in biology, chemistry, physics,
and mathematics, they may major in any of the three undergraduate
colleges.
A health professions advisory committee, which includes the preprofessional advisor and faculty members from the sciences and social
sciences, provides career and academic counseling and works closely
with students from first-year orientation through the entire process of
applying to professional schools. Students are urged to consult with
the pre-professional advisor in the Center for Career and Professional
Development as early as possible in their academic career. Those
students interested in other allied health fields may also consult with the
pre-professional advisor to obtain pertinent information to aid them in
planning their college careers.
Combined-Degree Program in Medicine

In cooperation with Drexel University College of Medicine, Lehigh offers
an accelerated program that enables selected students to earn both the
baccalaureate degree (B.A.) with a major in premedical science and
the M.D. degree after seven total years of study at the two institutions.
In the first three academic years at Lehigh, credit hours are earned
toward the 120 credits required for the baccalaureate degree. The next
four years are spent in the regular program of medical education at
Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. By successfully
completing their first year at the medical school, students acquire the
necessary additional credit hours for the Lehigh baccalaureate degree.
During their pre-professional years at Lehigh, students are expected to
make satisfactory progress in academic areas as well as in the more
subtle task of personal growth in those attributes ultimately needed as
a physician. Drexel University College of Medicine receives student
grades and monitors student progress through feedback from Lehigh.
Students are expected to attain specified grade point averages and
MCAT scores. Students’ undergraduate credentials are processed
through the Admissions Committee of Drexel University College of
Medicine before a final definitive acceptance is offered. The medical
college reserves the right to withdraw an offer of acceptance on the
grounds of academic or personal maturation concerns.

EDUCATION MINOR

The education minor helps undergraduates explore career options
in school teaching or other professional careers with elementary,
secondary, or special education students. The minor may accelerate
entry into a teaching career because appropriate credits from
undergraduate coursework may be applied to one of Lehigh's graduatelevel Teacher Education Programs.
The minor offers a systematic background of professional education
experiences, coordinating practicum activities with theory courses
designed to provide a foundation for future educational studies. Its focus
is exploratory.
The experiences of the minor are intended to enrich an individual's
understanding of education as a central intellectual activity of our culture
and to provide self-understanding of one's own potential as an educator.
An undergraduate may take these courses with the approval of the
adviser and minimum GPA of 2.75. Completion of the minor does not
assure admission to one of the Teacher Education Programs to become
a certified elementary or secondary teacher.
Fifteen credit hours are required for the education minor.
Completion of the minor does not guarantee subsequent admission into
any of the College of Education degree or certification programs.
For more information about our Education Minor, visit http://
coe.lehigh.edu/academics/disciplines/teachered or contact the Teaching,
Learning and Technology Program Director at TLTProgram@Lehigh.edu
or 610-758-3230.
FIVE-YEAR BACHELOR'S PLUS MASTER'S OF EDUCATION AND
SECONDARY TEACHER CERTIFICATION

The College of Education offers a five-year degree program that is
designed to allow students to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a
master’s degree in five years instead of the traditional six.
The combined degree program leads to (1) a B.A./B.S. degree in an
academic discipline from the College of Arts and Sciences, the P.C.
Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, or the College
of Business and Economics, and (2) an M.Ed. degree in elementary
education or an M.Ed. or M.A. degree in secondary education. In
addition, students also earn eligibility for an Instructional I teaching
certificate from the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). These

The College of Business and Economics offers the bachelor of science
degree in business and economics. In the dynamic global environment
of the 21st Century, today’s business students face unprecedented
challenges. Lehigh’s College of Business and Economics prepares
them to meet these challenges and to succeed. The mission of Lehigh
University’s College of Business and Economics is to provide an
intellectual and professional learning environment that advances
knowledge through research and scholarship and that develops
future leaders through experiential learning, rigorous analysis and the
discipline of a strong work ethic – the hallmarks of a Lehigh University
business education.
The College of Business and Economics consists of five departments:
accounting, economics, Perella Department of Finance, management
and marketing. Its programs, accredited by the AACSB International—
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business—provide
students with a solid foundation in business and economics principles.
In addition to the traditional undergraduate majors of accounting,
economics, finance, management and marketing, the College offers
innovative programs and courses that respond to today’s unique
business requirements, including:
The Business Information Systems major that answers a recognized
need in the business world. As businesses seek to make themselves
more productive and competitive, they have become more reliant
on information technology. Students with a good understanding of
information systems can help businesses enhance their use of this
technology.
The Supply Chain Management major is another response to the
complex environment facing business graduates. This undergraduate
major gives students solid exposure to supply management, logistics,
business-to-business marketing and operations management.
The College of Business and Economics has joined with the College
of Engineering to offer two cross-college programs. These programs,
Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) and Computer Science
and Business (CSB), are described in full in the following “Crossing
Boundaries” section.
All minors offered by the College of Arts and Sciences are available to
CBE undergraduate students. The engineering minor offered by the
College of Engineering is also available to all CBE undergraduates.
The following CBE minors are available to CBE students: business
information systems, international economics, public policy economics,
supply chain management, and management.

Freshmen, sophomores and juniors with a minimum overall GPA of 2.75
may apply to the 5-year teacher education program. Those accepted
typically begin education courses in the second semester of their
sophomore year (junior year for those admitted later).

In order to declare a CBE minor, students must first have a CBE
declared major. There is no overlapping credit between CBE major and
CBE minor courses or between CBE minors.

Criteria for admission to the program include:

A major strength of the College of Business and Economics is its ability
to develop programs by partnering across academic disciplines within
the College, across the colleges within the University and with the
business community. Students are able to cross traditional boundaries
and take advantage of all that the College of Business and Economics
and other colleges of the University have to offer. The partnerships built
with alumni and the business community afford students the opportunity
for internships in their areas of interest.

• A demonstrable commitment to learning and intellectual growth
• An expressed interest in teaching as a career
• Previous experience in working with young people; this can be
gained in the summers of freshman and sophomore years.
In the fall semester of their senior year, students must complete
an application for admission to the graduate College of Education
(elementary or secondary education) in order to continue in the
program and complete the master's degree/Instructional Level I teacher
certification eligibility portion of the program.

the Teaching, Learning, and Technology Program Director at
TLTProgram@Lehigh.edu or 610-758-3230.

CROSSING BOUNDARIES

As the needs in the marketplace change, the ingredients necessary
for success must reflect these new requirements. From courses in ecommerce to supply chain management and joint degree programs, the
College of Business and Economics provides today’s undergraduate
students with the skills necessary to become tomorrow’s business
leaders.

Career Placement

The undergraduate programs in the College of Business and Economics
provide the students with a strong foundation in business and economic
principles necessary for success in business. Upon graduation, the
majority of students from the College of Business and Economics enter
business in many different professional positions including accounting,
investment banking, advertising, marketing, management consulting,
and information systems. Further professional studies in law, graduate
business schools or specialized graduate education in economics,
operations research, or other related fields are additional options open to
graduates.
Variety of Options

While preparing students for a career in business and economics, we
recognize the importance of a well-rounded individual. At Lehigh, this
important exposure to science, language and the arts and humanities is
accomplished by distribution requirements, within which the student has
wide choice. Students take 48 credits outside the College of Business
and Economics.
The bachelor of science in business and economics may also lead to
admission into the master of business administration program at Lehigh
or another institution after graduates have at least 2-3 years of work
experience. In addition, the college also offers the following graduate
degrees: doctor of philosophy, master of business administration
and engineering, master of business administration and educational
leadership, master of science in accounting and information analysis,
master of science in analytical finance, master of science in economics,
and master of science in management.
BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS

The College of Business and Economics at Lehigh University prepares
students to become business and community leaders in a broad range
of organizations. Our undergraduate students acquire the knowledge
and skills needed to excel in business. Overall, we expect our graduates
to be able to successfully solve complex, unstructured business
problems.
For the bachelor of science degree in business and economics, 124
credit hours are required. A writing requirement, which is included within
the required 124 credit hours, is also a part of the college curriculum.

focuses on the planning and use of instructional technology in preK-12
and post secondary settings and non-formal learning environments
(such as museums and science centers). The program is targeted
toward individuals from varied backgrounds who wish to help educators
or learn themselves to design, develop, and incorporate technology
applications more effectively in diverse educational settings including
preK-12, post secondary education, and informal learning environments.
This is an appropriate degree for those who teach in the classroom and
online, technology specialists, informal educators, and others interested
in effectively using information and communications technologies to
enhance instruction. The program is designed to help develop skills

Lehigh University 2016-2017

that can be used to create new curriculum and learning activities to
meet the demands of a changing technological society and the needs
of new generations of students. As such, graduates may be designing
online courses, enhance existing curriculum with emerging technologies,
or may work as technology specialists, assisting with the integration
of technology in academic and informal learning environments. The
Instructional Technology graduate program is intended for both current
professionals in the education field as well as those who are seeking an
advanced degree to upgrade their skills and knowledge base related to
technology. The M.S. in teaching, learning and technology is available
only to students previously admitted to the TLT Ph.D. program and is
a "fallback" for those who have completed the core coursework but are
unable to progress through the culminating research projects.
MASTER IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION/MASTER OF EDUCATION
(MBA/M.ED.)

The MBA and master’s of education joint degree program offers
students the opportunity to acquire a solid foundation in both business
and education. Designed to increase the administrative skill required
in today’s educational systems, the MBA/M.Ed. provides a framework
in which excellent education and sound business practices can
flourish. The MBA/M.Ed. will provide an additional option for students
for business and students of educational leadership. The program
should enhance the student’s marketability in private and public sector
education while providing students with an understanding of the cultures
of both business and education.
EDUCATIONAL SPECIALIST (ED.S.)

Specialized post-master’s degree programs for practitioners are
available in school psychology.
CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS

The college offers programs of study leading to eligibility for
Pennsylvania state certifications in various professional specialties
including elementary and secondary teacher education, including
certification in special education; supervisor of special education,
pupil services, or curriculum and instruction; superintendent; and K-12
principal. Certification programs vary in the number of credits required.
POST-BACCALAUREATE CERTIFICATES

The college also offers post-baccalaureate certificate programs in
international counseling, international development in education, project
management (jointly offered through the College of Business and
Economics and the College of Education), special education, teacher
leadership, teaching English as a second language, and technology use
in the schools. Post-baccalaureate certificate programs differ from the
above-described certifications issued by agencies external to Lehigh
(such as the Pennsylvania Department of Education). Lehigh’s postbaccalaureate certificate programs are, instead, focused concentrations
of 12 to 15 credits that students complete to enhance their professional
credentials. Where appropriate, post-baccalaureate certificate programs
may be included as part of the coursework of a degree program. https://

2. Non-degree for external certification.
Regular non-degree admission is for students who wish to take up to
12 credits of graduate coursework at Lehigh University without seeking
a degree. Any transcript or other record from the University will clearly
indicate the student status as non-degree. Non-degree students are not
permitted to audit courses. University admissions criteria for non-degree
graduate students are (a) a bachelor's degree from an accredited
institution with an overall grade point average of at least 2.75 on a fourpoint scale (Applicants with undergraduate GPAs slightly below 3.0 may
be admitted with approval from the department of Education and Human
Services) or (b) to have achieved a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a fourpoint scale for a minimum of 12 graduate credits at another accredited
institution. If English is not your first language, you must submit TOEFL
scores.
Non-degree for external certification students are admitted to pursue
coursework for the purpose of obtaining certification through an external
accrediting agency. Applicants are expected to have an undergraduate
GPA of 3.0 or higher on a four-point scale or to have achieved a GPA of
3.0 or higher on a four-point scale for a minimum of 12 graduate credits
at another accredited institution. Applicants are assigned certification
advisers on admissions and must work with the adviser to assure that
they complete all requirements for certification satisfactorily. Students
complete the coursework and any other required field experiences
for the appropriate certification, with the number of credits and field
experiences being dictated by the external accrediting agency. Given
this external control of credit requirements, the number of credits will
vary and will typically exceed the 12 credit limit for regular non-degree
students. Certification involves qualitative components as well as
credits; a non-degree student seeking such certification must meet the
quality standards of the certification program, as well as completing the
necessary coursework and field experiences.
CHANGING FROM NON-DEGREE TO DEGREE STATUS

Non-degree students of either type may seek admission to a degree
program. Non-degree students who seek admission to a degree
program must meet all regular admissions criteria, complete all regular
application procedures, and present all documents normally required
of degree-seeking applicants to that program. Courses taken by a nondegree student who later enters a degree program will count towards
the completion of the program to the extent that those courses fall
within the normal requirements of the program and to the extent that
the student's performance in the course(s) is acceptable for degree
program purposes. Any course that is counted towards the completion
of a degree must be completed within the established time limits for that
degree, whether taken initially as a degree or non-degree course.

and Applied Science jointly offer the Computer Science and Business
(CSB) program. It is a four-year program that is fully accredited by
AACSB International, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of
Business, and by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,
http://www.abet.org .
Integrated Business & Engineering Honors Program

The Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program (IBE) is
offered jointly by the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied
Science and the College of Business and Economics. The program
recognizes the need for today’s leaders in business and industry to have
a sound foundation in both commerce and technology.
After four years and a minimum of 137 credits, students will receive
a single Bachelor of Science Degree in Integrated Business and
Engineering. The program meets the accreditation standards of the
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business. Students are
expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.25 in order to remain in the
program.
A second option is the five-year dual degree program. This option
allows students to obtain a second Bachelor of Science degree in
engineering by completing course work in the engineering field chosen
by the student as their IBE major. Students enrolled in the four year IBE
Honors Program and in satisfactory standing are able to transfer to a
dual-degree at any time, and stay within the honors program cohort. The
additional time necessary to complete the second degree will depend on
the curriculum selected, and the number of advanced placement credits.
The number of additional credit hours will typically be in the range of 20
to 30.
Students in the IBE Honors Program can major in nearly any area of
engineering or business that Lehigh offers. After their freshman year,
each student will declare a major in either the P. C. Rossin College
of Engineering and Applied Science or the College of Business and
Economics.

Lehigh University 2016-2017

Admission to the Integrated Business and Engineering Program is highly
selective, with annual admission limited to approximately 50 students.
The University’s Office of Admissions can explain the procedure for
applying to the program. It is possible that a small number of exceptional
students may be admitted to the program following the completion of
their freshman year. Admission at this point would be highly competitive
and based upon freshman year GPA, faculty recommendations, and
space availability.
The Co-Directors of the IBE Honors Program are Robert H. Storer,
Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering (rhs2@lehigh.edu)
and Stephen G. Buell, Professor of Finance (sgb2@lehigh.edu). For
additional information, see the IBE Honors Program or visit the IBE web
site at www.lehigh.edu/~inibep/inibep.html.
Integrated Degree Engineering, Arts and Sciences (IDEAS) Honors
Program

The B.S. in Integrated Engineering, Arts and Sciences (IDEAS) provides
students with a unique opportunity to combine the breadth and depth of
two focus areas, one from engineering and one from arts and sciences
in a four-year experience. More information is available in the IDEAS
entry in this catalog, or online at www.lehigh.edu/ideas.
Jointly administered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the P.C.
Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science, IDEAS is a fouryear honors program that allows students to earn a bachelor's degree
with concentrations in both colleges. In close collaboration with IDEAS
advisors and faculty directors, students admitted to this highly selective
honors program develop an individualized academic plan tailored to their
interests.
IDEAS allows students to study diverse interests such as bioengineering
and religion, computer science and graphic design, industrial
engineering and international relations, bioengineering and molecular
biology, and music and computer science. Key features of the program
include:
• Rigorous honors program: Each year, IDEAS accepts 30-40 highly
qualified first-year student candidates who have indicated an interest
in the program. Students must maintain a 3.25 grade point average
to continue.
• Team-based and individual projects: Each student builds toward a
capstone research project and thesis in their senior year, developed
through a combination of team-based and individualized instruction.
• Communication as key to bridging disciplines: IDEAS courses
are writing-intensive and presentation-oriented. Participation in the
program substitutes for some first-year courses in both colleges.
IDEAS graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Science degree, conferred
by both colleges. Students interested in pursuing a professionally
accredited degree in their selected engineering disciplines may choose
to do so in an optional fifth year of study. Some programs of study in the
College of Arts and Sciences, mainly in the sciences, may also require
further study to complete certification.
OTHER OPTIONS FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS
Cooperative Education (Co-Op)

Co-Op is available for undergraduates in the P.C. Rossin College of
Engineering and Applied Science; the program provides eight months of
paid, full-time work experience, bridging the gap between engineering
theory and application and allowing students to graduate within a four
year time-frame. Because of the rigorous academic schedule, the
program is selective.
The Co-Op schedule provides for interviews and selection by the
companies in the spring semester of the sophomore year. Those
students selected attend Lehigh for a challenging summer schedule
of junior-level coursework, then begin their first work rotation with the
sponsoring company in mid-August. This rotation will last until midJanuary when the student returns to Lehigh for the second semester
coursework of the junior year. The Co-Op experience is completed
with a second work rotation the following summer (mid-May through
August). Students earn three, free elective credits per successful work
assignment for a total of six free elective credits. These six credits are
in ENGR 200 (p. 215) and are taken as P/F (Pass/Fail).

provides students with insight into the world of engineers: who they are,
what they do, and how they think. Students pursuing the Engineering
Minor develop an understanding of the tools and techniques engineering
use on a day-to-day basis.
The mission of the minor is to educate non-engineering students about
engineering methodology, specifically how engineers solve problems;
how they design, manufacture, and analyze problems; and how other
factors such as economics, safety, ethics, and environmental issues
affect the engineering design process. Fifteen credit hours of required
and elective coursework are required to fulfill the engineering minor. For
more information about this minor: http://www.lehigh.edu/~inengmnr/

specialized fields of study. Graduate certificates consist of a minimum
of twelve credits, at least six of which must be at the 400-level.
Such certificates are specific to Lehigh and do not constitute official
certification, as might be required to be employed professionally.
Students are admitted to certificate programs in the same way as
to degree programs. More specific information on admission criteria
and completion requirements are available from certificate program
administrators.

Accounting Assurance and Tax Services, Financial Services and
Corporate Accounting, and Information Systems. In addition to the
undergraduate program, the Master of Science in Accounting and
Information Analysis degree (see Master of Science in Accounting
and Information Analysis program (p. 110)) offers an outstanding
opportunity to prepare graduate students for a career in today’s
demanding field of accounting. Lehigh’s unique program recognizes the
impact of technology on business processes and the value chain while
paying respect to the time honored usefulness of accounting information.
The Accounting Program recognizes the learning objectives set forth
by the College of Business and Economics as an integral part of the
curriculum, as well as the importance of providing students with a strong
foundation in liberal arts, humanities, and science as set out in the CBE
core curriculum. In addition to the CBE core curriculum, the accounting
curriculum is designed to foster the following learning objectives:
• Preparing and understanding general purpose financial statements
for parties outside the firm.
• Using accounting information for decision-making inside the firm.
• Understanding the information systems governing the flow of and
control over financial information inside the firm.
To the extent that the above objectives are achieved, Accounting
graduates will be well-prepared for positions in public accounting,
industry, not-for-profit organizations, and graduate school. Although
preparation for professional examinations is not a primary objective,
graduates will have the background to take professional examinations in
accounting.

Offered at the graduate level, American Studies is the interdisciplinary
study of American thought, literature, and culture–both past and present.
Born in the early years of the Cold War and with an implied commitment
to American exceptionalism, American Studies has since transformed
itself into a multifaceted critical examination of United States society.
Comparative frameworks along with close attention to applying cultural
and literary theory to such matters as violence, citizenship, democracy,
community, poverty and prosperity, politics, race, and gender in the
United States make American Studies an intellectually sophisticated yet
practical course of graduate study.

Director, Associate Dean of the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and
Applied Science
The Applied Science Program enables students to create
interdisciplinary specialties that prepare them for careers in a world that
increasingly bridges academic disciplines. Students pursue subject-area
concentrations that represent academic interests they wish to integrate
into a meaningful program. The core offers students the intellectual
tools to identify connections between the concentrations and engage in
interdisciplinary problem-solving and critical thinking.
The program leads to the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science. Each
student’s curriculum combines a general engineering education with a
carefully customized concentration in engineering and/or science as well
as another area of emphasis, which may include courses taken inside
the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering & Applied Science and may also
include courses taken in one or more of the other three Colleges within
the University.
In order to ensure the success of this individualized approach to
education, Applied Science places primary emphasis on advisement.
Each student is teamed with an advisor who helps the student plan the

Lehigh University 2016-2017

course of study and who supervises independent study and internships.
The advisor remains the student’s advisor throughout his or her
undergraduate career.
Unlike students in the traditional college programs, students in the
Applied Science program of individualized study do not declare a
major in a particular academic department. Instead, they develop a
concentration that may combine study in several areas. Students are
encouraged by their advisor to develop the concentration in such a
way that the student will be well prepared for further study in graduate
school or for pursuing a particular career path. While the chosen
concentration can be highly customized in consultation with the advisor,
examples of concentrations include: Technical Communications, Digital
Media, Entertainment Science, Technology/Science and Education,
Technology/Science and Pre-law, Technology/Science and PreMedicine, Technology Management, Technology Marketing, and
Engineering and Architecture. Many other combinations are possible.

the department offers undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degrees in four
majors: art, architecture, design, and art history. Minor programs are
available in studio art, architecture, graphic design, product design,
history of the visual arts, history of architecture, and museum studies.
Many studio courses require department permission. The student
interested in enrolling in any of the department’s courses should contact
the program coordinator to schedule an appointment with an advisor
well before preregistration so that he or she can be rostered at the
appropriate time.
An art major centers on studio education wherein principal disciplines
such as drawing, sculpture, painting and photography are explored. The
student is required to engage in an intense concentration in studio work
at Lehigh and when appropriate at other Lehigh Valley colleges that offer
complementary courses. Studio work is enhanced by courses in history
and theory, both within the department and throughout the university.
For the student interested in becoming a creative artist, the major
provides a foundation for a life in art, or more immediately the potential
path into a graduate degree program in fine art. A major in art may be
combined with theater for those interested in costume design, or with
architecture and theater for those who aspire to be set designers. A
major in art combined with a minor in education is available for students
interested in becoming primary, secondary or special education art
teachers.
The architecture major is a pre-professional course of study focused
on architectural design studios, complemented by art studios, history
and theory courses, and introductory materials and building technology
courses. The major results in a Bachelor of Arts degree.
The architecture major is a comprehensive undergraduate education
that is the first step in a series of educational and apprenticeship
requirements leading to professional registration. Architecture majors
regularly go on to the most respected graduate schools of architecture,
with Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, University of Virginia, and
Washington University in St. Louis, among scores of institutions, actively
seeking Lehigh graduates for their programs.

Alternatively, many architecture majors choose to work in fields allied to
the discipline, such as interior design, adaptive reuse building, historic
preservation, construction management, real estate development,
etc. Since for such paths professional architectural registration is not
required, the Lehigh degree alone is the springboard to various careers
that involve the making of the built environment.

(The Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in architecture should not
be confused with the Bachelor of Architecture, a professional five-year
degree. Those students who major in architecture and graduate with
the Bachelor of Arts degree and wish to pursue a professional career in
architecture will be required to obtain a Master of Architecture from an
institution offering a graduate program in architecture.)

Art, Architecture, and Design
The three primary disciplines of the Department of Art, Architecture and
Design share a common focus on design, visual literacy, the creative
process and the making of the built environment. The emphasis on
design as a broad concept begins to shape aesthetic principles, and
initiates the structuring of the individual’s creative process. To that end,

The Arts-Engineering program, a five-year, dual-degree course of
study, allows students to link complementary disciplines of engineering
and architecture. The result is two degrees from two different colleges
within Lehigh, one a professional degree in engineering, one the preprofessional degree in architecture.
A design major engages students with new technologies, materials
and media in developing the creative processes and critical thinking
necessary for the modern designer. The major centers on studio
wherein an emphasis on visual communication through digital media is
complemented by the traditional focus on art making. Courses in art and
design history and theory and in specific media techniques supplement
the series of required studios.
A student may take a range of department courses in design or may
choose a specific concentration in either graphic design or product
design. The graphic design concentration introduces students to
the tools and media related to print applications, web-based media,
exhibition design, publishing and advertising. Product design concerns
the creation of objects used in industrial applications, art objects,
furniture, toys, exhibits and trade design, electronic products, household
items and recreational equipment.
An art history major provides students with a comprehensive education
in the history of art and architecture, and an opportunity to learn about
the changing form and status of the visual arts and built environment in

74

Art, Architecture, and Design

culture and society. Through introductory and advanced coursework,
as well as museum and site visits, students learn how to examine,
evaluate, and interpret works of art and architecture, and acquire a
working knowledge of the methods, theories and research practices of
art historical analysis.
The study of art and its history is a vital and fundamental part of a
liberal arts education, and art history is unique among academic fields
in the breadth and diversity of its objects of study: drawing, painting,
sculpture, and printmaking; architecture, design, and urban planning;
photography and film; material culture; as well as a variety of other
cultural forms. Students majoring in art history go on to careers in art,
architecture, design, curating, communications, imaging, advertising,
education, and many other fields. The major also provides an important
foundation for students who plan to pursue advanced graduate studies
in the arts and humanities. Art history majors choose one of three areas
of concentration: history of the visual arts, history of architecture, or
museum studies.
All programs are philosophically cross-disciplinary, as students are
encouraged to take advantage of the many learning environments that
constitute a university. Significant resources for all disciplines in the
department include the Lehigh University permanent art collection and
archives as well as the numerous on-campus galleries and the Zoellner
Art Center. Students are encouraged to make use of the collections and
facilities to enhance and enrich studios and courses, and to help shape
their own creative work.
The department offers minor programs in studio art, architecture,
graphic design, product design, history of the visual arts, history of
architecture, museum studies that are available to all undergraduate
students. The purpose of these minor programs is to enable students
from any major to be introduced to the studio practices of art,
architecture, and design, and to help form an understanding of the role
that art plays in human history and culture.

Selection of a major in the College of Engineering and Applied Science
occurs prior to beginning the sophomore year. A major leading to a
degree in the College of Arts and Sciences should be chosen prior to
beginning the junior year.
Arts-Engineering candidates should recognize that pursuit of a bachelor
of science degree (e.g., biology, chemistry, biochemistry, earth and
environmental sciences, mathematics, and physics) or a bachelor of
arts program with larger than average credit requirements (e.g., art,
architecture, physical sciences, cognitive science, international careers,
among others) will severely restrict choices of free electives.
Courses selected must fulfill major and distribution requirements of both
the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering and
Applied Science.
For all students, very careful planning of the academic program done
in consultation with advisers in both colleges is necessary to guarantee
completion of all major, distribution and total credit requirements for the
two degrees in five years.
When selected properly, courses meet distribution requirements in
the College of Arts and Sciences while also satisfying distribution
requirements of the College of Engineering and Applied Science.
A course of study in Arts-Engineering may link any College of
Engineering and Applied Science discipline degree program with any
College of Arts and Sciences major. Please see individual departments
for details concerning required courses and sequences for completing
discipline – specific degrees and combinations of degree requirements
for Arts Engineering. Below is a template listing all courses required for
a civil engineering-architecture combination (the most common ArtsEngineering linkage). Please note that the large number of required
credits for both degrees means that this combination results in a larger
number of total credits than is required for some other combinations.

The Asian Studies program provides undergraduates an opportunity to
acquire a systematic knowledge of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South
Asia. The program focuses on the rich historical and cultural heritage
of the countries of Asia, as well as their growing importance in world
affairs.
The overall program is administered by the Asian Studies Committee,
an interdisciplinary body of faculty with special interests in the region.
This committee oversees both the formal academic work within the
program as well as extracurricular activities. It also cooperates with the
Asian Cultural Society and other student organizations involved in Asian
Studies.
The courses listed are regularly offered in the program and new ones
are currently under development in several subject areas. (Consult the

The Asian Studies major is designed to accomplish three goals: to
ground the student in a regional language and culture, to survey various
disciplines in Asian Studies more broadly, and to provide advanced
research opportunities. The program, when successfully completed,
prepares the student for further graduate work, professional education,
or employment in the public or private sector. There is an increasing
demand for graduates who combine a major in a disciplinary field (e.g.,
business, economics, international relations) with a second major (or
minor) in Asian Studies, including Chinese or Japanese language
competence.

Astronomy and Astrophysics
Astronomy and Astrophysics are offered in the department of Physics.
Astrophysicists apply physics and mathematics to the study of planets,
stars, galaxies, pulsars, black holes, quasars and the universe, among
many other fascinating objects in order to understand their origin,
evolution and ultimate fate. Students who major in astronomy or
astrophysics usually have very inquisitive minds and a good aptitude for
physics and mathematics. The bachelor degree programs in astronomy
and astrophysics provide the student with a solid background in
laboratory and theoretical astrophysics as well as in the fundamentals
of physics and mathematics. Research opportunities are available to
supplement classroom instruction.
The bachelor of science degree in astrophysics is designed for students
who wish to go on to graduate studies in astrophysics with the goal
of becoming professional astronomers. Professional astronomers
generally find positions at colleges, and universities, national labs, NASA
or its contractors and in various space industries. This degree also
prepares you for many jobs in related fields such as computer science,
mathematics or physics.
The bachelor of arts degree in astronomy is intended for students who
desire a broad background in astronomy, mathematics and physics
but do not plan to do graduate work in astrophysics. With this broad
background, the student is well prepared in many fields of endeavor,
including planetarium and museum work, teaching astronomy at
colleges and universities, secondary education, science writing, or in
many professions in which the ability to learn is critical.

88

Astronomy and Astrophysics

Both of these degrees can be profitably combined with mathematics and
other sciences producing excellent double majors or double degrees.
A minor program in astronomy is also available for students who wish to
enlarge their potential for a career choice or who may be eager to learn
more about astrophysics than an introductory course can provide.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM

The B.S. in Bioengineering degree provides a structured curriculum
comprised of three tracks. Biopharmaceutical Engineering is for students
whose interests lie in genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, recombinant
DNA, protein engineering, bioprocessing, drug synthesis and delivery.
The Bioelectronics/photonics track covers education and research
dealing with signal processing, biosensors, MEMs, biochips for DNA
sequencing, laser and fiber based optical technology for biomedical
applications. The Biomechanics and Biomaterials track encompasses

91

applications of engineering principles to an understanding of biology and
physiology, ranging from cells and tissues to organs and systems.
The B.S. in Bioengineering will prepare students for careers in
established and emerging fields that require combining engineering
principles with the life sciences. Potential paths open to students include
the health care, biomedical, pharmaceutical, biomaterials, and other
biotechnology related industries through careers in medicine or graduate
studies.
The program strongly encourages experiential learning, including two
summers of internships, required participation in Lehigh's Technical
Entrepreneurship Capstone Design Projects, and opportunities for
undergraduate research for credit.
A total of 132 credit hours are required for graduation with a degree of
bachelor of science in bioengineering.

Biological Sciences
The biological sciences include the study of living systems at levels
ranging from the structure and function of molecules to the behavior
and evolution of communities of organisms. The department offers four
different routes to mastering skills and knowledge in this broad area.
The B.A. and B.S. programs in biology provide a broad introduction
to biology with opportunities for students to create a program of

Lehigh University 2016-2017

study suited to their specific interests. Programs of study focused on
particular aspects of biology are the B.A. and B.S. degree in the areas
of behavioral neuroscience and molecular biology. For programs in
biochemistry and bioengineering, see those separate sections in the
catalog.
The Department of Biological Sciences strongly supports the positions of
both the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the
National Academy of Sciences that intelligent design is not scientific and
should not be presented as science in science classes.
The requirements for the B.A. and B.S. in biology, behavioral
neuroscience, and molecular biology are listed below. Research
interests of the faculty and instrumentation are described in the section
on graduate education.

GRADUATE STUDY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES

Rigorous, research-oriented graduate programs leading to a Doctor of
Philosophy are offered in three divisions of the Department of Biological
Sciences: biochemistry, integrative biology and neuroscience, and
cell and molecular biology. To complete the program students must
successfully complete core courses, pass a qualifying exam, prepare,
submit, and successfully defend a written research proposal, complete
the research described in the proposal, and submit a written dissertation
and defend the completed research to the department.
Once students enter the department, their progress is monitored by
the graduate committee until they are admitted to candidacy. Members
of the committee meet with the student each semester to assess
the student's progress towards the degree and to assist students in
choosing the appropriate courses to provide a solid scientific foundation
and an up-to-date understanding of the discipline. This will be assessed
by the qualifying exam.
The qualifying exam generally should be taken after the third semester
and no later than the fourth semester of course work. It will be prepared,
administered and graded by the faculty associated with the specific
graduate program in which the student is enrolled. It consists of a twoday written exam and an oral examination. The exam can be repeated

102

Biological Sciences

once. Admission to candidacy is granted after successful completion of
the qualifying exam and the thesis proposal. The proposal is a written
description of an original research project developed under the guidance
of a faculty member chosen by the student to be his/her advisor. The
proposal will be presented orally to the thesis committee, typically
after the fifth semester. Following the presentation of the proposal,
an oral examination will take place in which the thesis committee will
question the student about general science related to the project. This
will constitute the general examination.

Core requirements for each division are listed below. The graduate
school requires students to register for at least 72-post baccalaureate
credits to earn the Ph.D. In addition, all students must take BIOS 408
(0 credits) Responsible Conduct of Science within their first year of
graduate study. All students must also attend departmental seminars
and enroll in BIOS 406 (1 credit) Biological Sciences Seminar at least
twice in the first four semesters. A minimum of 24 course credits may be

commercial real property, the class engages in the study of the
physical and locational characteristics of commercial real estate as
they relate to value including: property history; architecture; physical
attributes that add to or detract from value; tenant mix; the immediate
neighborhood environment; and, the specific market in which the real
property competes for tenants. Each team meets with the property
owner and conducts a thorough review of the property’s development
process including, where applicable, previous attempts to develop the
property, prior uses for the property, and significant phase points in
the development process (for example, “deal killing” impediments that
were overcome). Each team submits a written report of their findings
and produces a 10-minute video documentary on their subject property.
Permission of the instructor required.
IPRE 348 Practicum in Real Estate II 2 Credits
A continuation of the study of the creation of value in commercial real
estate begun in the Practicum in Real Estate I. Each student team
continues with the subject commercial real property assigned to them in
Practicum I. The class engages in the study of the market and financial
characteristics of commercial real estate as they relate to value through:
a financial analysis of the market in which their property is located to
include market rents, market vacancy rates and market absorption rates;
and, financial analysis of the subject property to include both historical
results, and pro forma estimates of revenues, expenses, cash flow and
residual value. Each team also studies the financial characteristics of
comparable properties. The grand finale of the Real Estate Practicum
(and the IPRE curriculum) is the Collins Family Scholarship Competition.
Held at the conclusion of the spring semester, this competition is the
public vehicle for the Practicum teams to present the results of their
property studies. Consent of instructor required.

Curriculum Overview

GRADUATE DEGREES IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AND
ECONOMICS

Candidates for admission to graduate study in the College of Business
and Economics must provide the results obtained in the Graduate
Management Admissions Test (GMAT) for the degree in accounting and
information analysis. The GMAT or the Graduate Record Examination
general test (GRE) must be submitted for degrees in business
administration, analytical finance, economics and management.
International applicants are required to take the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL) for admission to the program.
MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

The Lehigh MBA program is accredited by AACSB International- the
Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The Lehigh
MBA program provides a rich learning experience for students. The
College of Business and Economics offers two MBA programs: the One
Year Full-Time MBA program (1-MBA) and the Flex MBA program.
ONE YEAR FULL-TIME MBA PROGRAM

The One Year Full-Time MBA Program (henceforth 1-MBA) is designed
for individuals who already have at least three years’ work experience
and wish to either pivot their careers into a business-related area
which may not be in their previous field of employment, or accelerate
their career within their chosen field. This MBA program is designed
to accommodate those from non-business related fields, as well as
students whose undergraduate major is in business but who may want
to change their focus, such as from finance to marketing.
The 1-MBA program, which starts each January, is a cohort-based,
lockstep program initially to develop core knowledge of functional
areas and team building. These courses emphasize a stakeholder
perspectives approach. Following this, students are required to embark
on an internship/equivalent experience. The final part of the program
emphasizes building domain expertise via electives and a focus on
data analytics and project management. Another feature is a dedicated
coaching team consisting of a professional staff member, an alumnus,
and a faculty member.
1-MBA Mission Statement
The One Year Full-Time MBA Program (henceforth 1-MBA) develops
and positions students for organizational and career success as
strategic thinkers in an environment that seeks solutions beneficial to
business and society. In a 12-month program format, it provides not
only a rigorous and comprehensive coverage of fundamental business
principles but also helps students use an integrated framework for
addressing large, multi-stakeholder organizational challenges. Students
in the 1-MBA program will apply their learning with an in-depth summer
internship experience and also will have opportunities of extensive
networking with peers, alumni, experienced executives, faculty, and
coaching professionals.
Program Admission Requirements
Admission to the 1-MBA program will be based on standardized
scores on the GMAT or GRE, college transcripts with undergraduate
degree conferred, 3 recommendation letters, candidate essays, and
interviews. Three (3) years of professional work experience is required.
International students must show English proficiency as measured by
the TOEFL.
Program Requirements
The following are pre-requisites for students prior to arrival on campus to
begin the program:
1. Calculus knowledge as evidenced by an acceptable grade in a
college-level calculus class
2. English proficiency (for international students) as evidenced by a high
TOEFL score and via interviews by the admissions committee

FLEX MBA PROGRAM

Lehigh’s Flex MBA curriculum is a fully integrated model which simulates
the business environment in the classroom. Business issues are viewed
and taught from the perspective of the firm as a whole rather than along
departmental lines. Flex MBA students acquire skills in leadership,
managerial communication, and resource allocation coupled with a
comprehensive understanding of complex domestic and global business
issues.
Due to the compact and integrated core, students have increased
flexibility to tailor the program to their individual needs. Students
may select a concentration in corporate entrepreneurship, finance,
international business, marketing, project management, or supply chain
management or pursue a broader experience by selecting courses from
a variety of disciplines. Students may only have one concentration.
The Flex MBA program is available both on campus and online.
Students may opt to attend class through both methods of delivery. Flex
MBA concentrations in finance, international business, marketing, and
supply chain management are currently available through online study.
Flex MBA Mission Statement
The Flex MBA program will further the development of organizational
leaders and managers. This is accomplished by honing students’
knowledge, skills and abilities through a comprehensive and integrated
core curriculum and customized concentrations designed to meet
individual needs. The Flex MBA program will also foster life-long
learning through continuing professional education programs.
Innovative Structure
The Flex MBA Program requires 36 credit hours. Full-time students can
fulfill that requirement in 12 to 16 months. Part-time students average
three years to complete the degree.

MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS

The Lehigh Master of Science in Accounting and Information Analysis
(MSAIA) degree program offers an outstanding opportunity to prepare
for a career in today’s demanding field of accounting. Accounting
professionals are engaged in a variety of services, including assurance
(auditing), business valuation, information resources, and consulting.
The program focuses on using information and technology to improve
business processes and forge business solutions. Accredited by
AACSB International, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools
of Business, Lehigh’s M.S. in Accounting and Information Analysis
program satisfies the 150-hour CPA educational requirement adopted
by almost all states. The program serves as an excellent foundation for
professional careers as CPAs, CMAs and related fields. It provides the
broad business education employers value so highly.
The Master of Science in Accounting and Information Analysis
curriculum is designed to be flexible so that students may choose to
concentrate their electives in a specific field, such as finance, or use
them for breadth.
Students are encouraged to obtain an internship during the summer
prior to beginning the program. The internship will complement the
chosen concentration and provide an excellent practical framework to
enrich the academic coursework experience.
Non-Accounting Majors
The M.S. in Accounting and Information Analysis program seeks
applicants from a variety of academic backgrounds. Those with
undergraduate business degrees in fields other than accounting often
lack eighteen credits of background requirements in intermediate
accounting, cost accounting, accounting information systems,
fundamentals of federal income taxation and auditing. To the
extent possible, applicants should take those courses during their
undergraduate programs.

113

Applicants who do not have an undergraduate business degree will likely
require two years to complete the program. The first year is devoted to
background courses and the second to the graduate program itself.
Mission Statement
Lehigh University’s Master of Science in Accounting and Information
Analysis provides a broad business education and the specialized
coursework for a professional career in accounting. Graduates aspire to
leadership positions at top-tier organizations in fields that include public

information systems. Through this program, Lehigh continues a long
tradition of providing accounting majors with the necessary educational
requisites for licensure as certified public accountants within the United
States and its territories. The program seeks only the best and the
brightest applicants: motivated, dedicated to their studies, not afraid
of challenges, possessing confidence, self-discipline, and the ability
to articulate their ideas orally and in writing. The program continually
pursues the excellence necessary to meet the standards of only the
highest-quality educational institutions.
Core Program
The MSAIA core consists of fifteen credits in the courses shown below
and thirty credits overall. Designed specifically for this program, and
dedicated to it, these innovative courses seek to develop a set of skills
and experiences not available in undergraduate programs that will
enhance MSAIA students’ ability to perform throughout their chosen
careers. Core courses are offered once each academic year.

Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering

The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department offers a
Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering to undergraduate
students and offers graduate programs leading to the master of science,
master of engineering, and doctor of philosophy degrees in Chemical
Engineering, and master of engineering degrees in Biological Chemical
Engineering and Chemical Energy Engineering.
Modern chemical engineering is built around the fundamental
enabling sciences of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
Its curriculum encompasses three basic organizing principles:
Molecular Transformations, Multi-scale Analysis, and System
Approaches. Chemical engineers serve a wide variety of technical
and managerial functions within the chemical processing industry.
For a lifetime of effectiveness they need a sound background in the
fundamental sciences of chemistry and physics; a working capability
with mathematics, numerical methods, and application of computer
solutions; and a broad education in humanities, social sciences,
and managerial techniques. These bases are applied in a sequence
of chemical engineering courses in which logic and mathematical
manipulation are applied to chemical processing problems. With the
resulting habits of precise thought coupled to a broad base in scientific
and general education, Lehigh graduates have been effective throughout
industry and in advanced professional education. No effort is made
toward any specific industry, but adaptation is rapid and the fundamental
understanding forms the base for an expanding career.
The program is also designed to prepare a student for graduate
study in chemical and biomolecular engineering. Further study at the
graduate level leading to advanced degrees is highly desirable if an
individual wishes to participate in the technical development of the
field. The increasing complexity of modern manufacturing methods
requires superior education for men and women working in research,
development, and the design fields or for teaching.

Chemistry
Chemistry is a versatile subject area and the pursuit of a career in
chemistry can be a most intellectually satisfying experience. No other
basic science touches and shapes as many aspects of modern society
as does chemistry. The study of chemistry has provided solutions to
complex problems and has improved the quality of all phases of human
life from soft contact lenses and synthetic blood to longer-lasting paint
and alternative fuels. A particular strength of this department is in
surface and interface chemistry, which bridges many areas of modern
science and technology.
Chemists at all levels of education find a market for their skills and
knowledge in many employment areas. Chemists provide the technical
backbone for the manufacturing industries (pharmaceuticals, plastics,
paper, semiconductor electronics technology, and agriculture),
for service industries (clinical and forensic laboratories, academe,
environmental protection, and information science) and for governmental
positions in regulatory agencies and in science policy analyses. Many
chemists are employed in nontraditional areas, such as patent law,
insurance underwriting, sales, product management, journalism, and
even banking.
The alluring challenge of chemistry inspires many bachelor degree
recipients to study for advanced degrees within the discipline of
chemistry and in other areas, as well. Chemistry or biochemistry is
the strongest preparation for graduate studies or for professional
school in the health-related disciplines (medicine, pharmacology, and
biochemistry), and for other science programs (materials science,
polymers, biotechnology, environmental studies, and mineralogy).
The study of chemistry opens doors to satisfying careers, to a
stimulating view of the world, and to a professional life in which one’s
natural tendency to ask “Why?” can lead to personally rewarding
endeavors. The undergraduate curriculum in chemistry contains many
of the prerequisites for biology, earth and environmental sciences,
materials science, molecular biology, physics, and chemical engineering.
This allows students to transfer credits among these majors through the
sophomore year.

Lehigh University 2016-2017

Chemistry students have the opportunity to design their undergraduate
curricula for specialization in a variety of fields through the ChemFlex
curriculum.
THE CHEMFLEX CURRICULUM

The Department of Chemistry offers degrees in both the College
of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering and Applied
Sciences. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences have three
options: the B. S. in Chemistry, the B. A. in Chemistry, and the B. S. in
Pharmaceutical Chemistry. In addition we offer an interdepartmental
B. S. in Biochemistry in collaboration with the Department of Biological
Sciences. For students in the College of Engineering and Applied
Sciences we offer the B. S. in Chemistry.
In the College of Arts and Sciences, the traditional degree certified
by the American Chemical Society is offered; the B. S. degree in the
College of Engineering is very similar to the certified degree. All B.
S. programs have a Common Chemistry Core and similar collateral
science requirements. These programs are pre-professional in nature,
and students planning to attend graduate school in chemistry or an
allied science should elect the B. S. program in the college to which they
have been admitted. The traditional B. A. Program in the College of Arts
and Sciences is not a pre-professional program and may be elected
by students who do not plan to do graduate work in chemistry or allied
sciences but who desire a stronger background in chemistry than is
provided by a chemistry minor.
In addition to the traditional certified B. S degree and B. A. degree, the
B. A. and B. S. Chemistry programs in the College of Arts and Sciences
feature an alternative flexible curriculum, called ChemFlex, which
enables a student to concentrate in a specific area. The concentrations
possible for the B. S. are Physical/Analytical, Polymers, and Materials.
The B. A. has two areas of concentration: Business and the Health
Professions. All concentrations in ChemFlex share a Common
Chemistry Core; all students complete the core and then follow one of
two paths (Path A or Path B) as outlined in the following lists.
Students may transfer from a B. S. program to a B. A. program easily,
but the reverse is more difficult. Students in a B. A. program who make
the decision to attend graduate school in chemistry or allied sciences
can achieve a minimum preparation for this transition by electing
307 Advanced Inorganic Chemistry.
DEPARTMENT MODERN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
REQUIREMENT

The modern foreign language requirement is met by one of three
options:
1. Completion of the second semester of a modern foreign language;
2. Certification of language equivalent to this level taken in high school;
3. Substitution of six credits of science electives. If science electives
are chosen, the non-science distribution requirement must still be
met.

DEGREES IN THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES

In the College of Arts and Sciences the Chemistry Department offers
three degrees: a B.S. in Chemistry, a B.A. in Chemistry and a B.S. in
Pharmaceutical Chemistry with an interdepartmental B.S. Biochemistry
degree with the Department of Biological Sciences. The ChemFlex
Curriculum allows the flexibility for a student to develop a concentration
in a specific area if he/she wishes to do so. The specific concentrations
are noted in the following Table.

With regard to the B.S. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry, the pharmaceutical
industry is focused on exploring the biochemistry of disease and
designing or finding drugs to cure or ameliorate disease. Biochemists,
organic chemists, biologists, and chemical engineers collaborate to
achieve this end. The majority of chemists hired today go into the
pharmaceutical industry. The B.S. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry is a
chemistry degree option which focuses on core chemistry, biochemistry,
and molecular biology to prepare students for careers in this field. Since
it is a highly interdisciplinary field it requires the breadth of knowledge
offered by this degree program.

Individual degree paths can be designed to earn either the B.S. or both
BS. and M.S. degrees in Chemistry over a reduced or accelerated time
frame. A discussion with the Chemistry faculty advisor during the first
academic year is required to successfully complete any of the following
options:
1. If you have more than 20 credits total of AP or transfer courses,
it may be possible to earn the B.S. in three years and the M.S. in
four. This path may require up to two summers of courses and/or
research for most students.
2. If you have 30 or more AP or transfer credits, then it may be possible
to be supported as a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant
during the fourth year as a graduate student to finish the M.S.
degree, although such support is not guaranteed. The B.S. degree
must be completed in three years, and up to two summers of
courses and/or research may be required.
3. If you have limited or no AP or transfer credits, then two paths
are available: A) A five year path is possible with one summer of
research work after the B.S. degree is finished in four years. B)
A five year path with support during the fifth year as a TA or RA
may be possible if courses are excluded from the undergraduate
degree (requiring course overloads), and one summer of research is
generally required, but support is not guaranteed.
Accelerated B.S. degree options are also possible for some students.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN CHEMISTRY

The department of chemistry offers graduate studies leading to several
advanced degrees. Master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees
in chemistry may be obtained by study and research in any appropriate
area of chemistry.
The following information on admissions, proficiency examinations
and other policies applies to both the master of science and doctor of
philosophy degrees in chemistry.
Admission to graduate study in chemistry assumes that a student has
met, or is willing to meet though further study, minimum undergraduate
requirements for a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. This would include
(beyond two semesters of introductory chemistry) two semesters of
organic chemistry, two semesters of physical chemistry, two semesters
of analytical chemistry and one semester of inorganic chemistry. A
promising student whose degree is in a field related to chemistry (e.g.,
biology, chemical engineering) may be admitted to graduate study in
chemistry provided that any deficiencies in basic chemistry preparation
are made up in the first year of graduate study, noting that some of the
courses required for this may not carry graduate credit.
The chemistry department administers proficiency examinations
at the advanced undergraduate level in analytical, biochemistry,
inorganic, organic and physical chemistry to all regular graduate
students at the time of matriculation. Each student is required to take
three examinations. Information regarding material to be covered on
these examinations will be sent to each student several months in
advance of matriculation. It is expected that each student will prepare
diligently for these tests. A student who performs well on one or more
of these tests has an opportunity to take advanced level and special
topics courses at an earlier than normal time and may in fact begin
graduate research during the first year. A Ph.D. candidate must show
proficiency in three areas and an M.S. candidate in two areas within
the first year in residence. A student who fails one or more of the
proficiency examinations will meet with Professor Miller, faculty graduate
administrator, to determine an appropriate course of action in light of the
exam performance, projected major and degree aspiration. Two optional
routes are available for demonstration of proficiency. (1) The student
through self-study and auditing of appropriate courses may prepare for
a retaking of a proficiency examination at the beginning of the second
semester in residence. (2) Alternatively, the student may enroll in
appropriate 400 level courses during the first year in residence. A grade
of B- or better in an appropriate 400 level course will be considered
equivalent to passing the proficiency examination in that area. Courses
taken as a means of demonstrating proficiency will be acceptable for the
M.S. or Ph.D. graduate program.
Master of Science in Chemistry degree

There are no other specifically required courses for the M.S. degree,
allowing each student to design a curriculum that fits their needs and

Doctor of Philosophy Degree

Completion of a doctor of philosophy degree program normally requires
a minimum of four years fulltime work after entrance with a bachelor’s
degree. There are few specific course credit requirements for the Ph.D.;
however, approved degree programs generally have at least 24 hours
of course work (including any applied toward a master’s degree) and 6
credits of research. Thus, the program consists of approximately onethird formal course work and two-thirds independent study and research.
There is a two-credit seminar requirement (CHM 481). After Ph.D.
proficiency has been established and the research advisor selected (this
must be done by the end of the first year in residence), the major hurdles
are the doctoral examination in the student’s area of concentration.
This exam must be passed by the end of 2 1/2 years of residence. If
this hurdle is surmounted, the remaining time is spent completing (and
ultimately defending) the dissertation research under the guidance of the
research advisor and the dissertation committee.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) has
graduate degree programs leading to Master’s and Ph.D. degrees
in: Civil Engineering, Structural Engineering, and Environmental
Engineering.
The department offers advanced work in the specialty areas of
structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resources
engineering, and environmental engineering. Degrees offered are:
M.Eng., M.S., Ph.D. in Structural Engineering
M.Eng., M.S., Ph.D. in Civil Engineering
M.Eng., M.S., Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering
The programs educate students through coursework and independent
study and research. Our programs are designed to provide students
with the knowledge and analytical problem-solving capabilities needed
to lead and innovate within multi-disciplinary teams in technologicallycomplex environments.
Graduate studies in the department of civil and environmental
engineering enable the student to build upon the broad background of
undergraduate education in preparation for professional practice at an
advanced level, for research and development, or for teaching.
A graduate program leading to the M.S. normally is concentrated in
one, or possibly two, of the technical specialty areas, and consists of a
number of courses designed to fulfill the individual student’s program
objectives. Each candidate for the M.S. is required to submit a thesis
representing three to six credit hours (CEE 491), or alternatively, a
report based on a research course of at least three credits (CEE 429,
CEE 439, CEE 449, CEE 479 or CEE 481). The balance of the program
will consist of courses in the specialty area(s).
A graduate program leading to the M.Eng. degree stresses engineering
applications and design. The department offers two different M.Eng.
degrees. The M.Eng. in Structural Engineering focuses specifically
on structural engineering. Candidates for the M.Eng. in Structural
Engineering degree complete a group design project and an individual
project as part of a 3-course design project sequence (CEE 416,
CEE 417, CEE 418). The M.Eng. degrees in Civil Engineering
and Environmental Engineering allow students to select courses
across the various specialty areas of civil and environmental
engineering. Candidates for the M.Eng. degrees in Civil Engineering and
Environmental Engineering have the option to complete an individual
engineering project or a research report, representing 3 to 6 credits
(CEE 480), or may take 30 course credits with no project or report.
The doctoral program, which leads to the Ph.D., normally includes
courses in the major field, courses in minor fields, and a dissertation

147

presenting results of original research. Holders of master’s degrees
planning to become candidates for the Ph.D. take a qualifying
examination. After qualification, the candidate, the candidate’s
departmental Ph.D. committee, and the department chair formulate the
program of work.
The departmental laboratories are located in the Fritz Engineering
Laboratory and in the STEPS Building. The laboratories offer
outstanding facilities for research and instruction in structural
engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resources engineering,
and environmental engineering. In particular, the structural testing
equipment includes dynamic testing machines, a five-million-pound
universal hydraulic testing machine, and other state-of-the-art facilities.
Included in the latter are the facilities of the Center for Advanced
Technology for Large Structural Systems (ATLSS center) located on
the mountaintop campus. These include the largest 3-dimensional test
bed in the U.S.A. and specialized earthquake testing facilities of the
NSF George E. Brown, Jr. Network Earthquake Engineering Simulation
(NEES). The water resources facilities include a wave tank, several
flumes, a 10-cfs recirculating flow system, and two multipurpose tanks
for model studies. The geotechnical facilities include state-of-the-art,
fully automated triaxial compression and permeability machines for
multiple simultaneous tests. The environmental facilities include stateof-the-art laboratories and analytical instrumentation for analysis of
chemical, physical and microbiological systems.
In addition to departmental courses, a number of courses offered by
the departments of mechanical engineering and mechanics, chemistry,
chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, earth and
environmental sciences, and biology may also be considered a part
of the major field in civil and environmental engineering. A number of
research and teaching assistantships are available to provide financial
support to students of outstanding promise. The research or teaching
activities required of holders of assistantships provides a valuable
educational experience that supplements the formal course offerings.
A very limited number of scholarships and fellowships are available to
provide financial support for full-time study.

This program is designed for students interested in combining programs
in two departments: Civil & Environmental Engineering and Earth &
Environmental Science, leading to two bachelor of science degrees, one
in Civil Engineering or Environmental Engineering and the other in Earth
and Environmental Sciences. Both degrees would be awarded at the
end of the fifth year. This program is one of the dual degree programs
mentioned in the Five-Year Programs section. The student will have a
primary advisor in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied
Sciences and a secondary advisor in the Arts and Sciences College.
The program provides alternatives for students who may decide not to
complete the dual-degree program. Students who make this decision
prior to the beginning of the fourth year may qualify at the end of that
year for the bachelor of science in civil or environmental engineering, as
well as a minor in earth and environmental sciences. Also, if a student
decides after two years to pursue only a bachelor of science degree
in the EES department, it is possible to complete the requirements in
four years. If the decision to work toward this degree is made during
the fourth year, at least one additional semester is required to qualify
for either B.S. degree. Interested students should consult with the
respective departmental advisors to create a schedule of courses to

(Department of Sociology and Anthropology)
The study of Classics examines first the origins and growth of Greek
and Roman culture in the Mediterranean area and second its impact
on that area (and others) until the present. This study is by nature
interdisciplinary: the study of language and literature, history, philosophy
and religion, archaeology, economics and science all contribute to an
appreciation of Greco-Roman civilization.
Students in either major or minor programs may concentrate in various
combinations of these and other disciplines as they relate to ancient
civilization. The diversity of the program should encourage the student
to follow her or his special interests while simultaneously gaining an
overview of classical civilization.
Courses in ancient Greek and Latin lead to proficiency in language while
introducing the student to major literary texts. The Joseph A. Maurer
Classics Prize is awarded yearly, at the discretion of the program, to the
senior(s) who has demonstrated outstanding achievement in Classics
(ancient Greek or Latin) and/or classical civilization. Courses in classical
civilization require no knowledge of the ancient languages; they offer
introductions to various disciplines of Classics with frequent reference
to modern perspectives. Upper-level courses tend to be small, fostering
closeness between faculty and students.
Petitions are required for freshmen to take 100-level or higher courses
and for sophomores to take 200-level or higher courses.
Major Programs

Students may major either in Classical Civilization or in Classics. The
Classics major offers a comprehensive view of language and culture; it
is possible to begin an ancient language at Lehigh and to complete the
major program successfully. The classical civilization major enables the
student to gain a broad perspective on Greek and Roman civilization.
The program welcomes double majors and the educational perspectives
to be derived from combining ancient and modern studies.
Classics as a major has stood the test of time, offering helpful
preparation for careers in widely diverse fields in the professions,
business, and public service. Lehigh Classics majors have gone on to
law school, to the ministry, to business school, with appropriate science
courses to medical school, to graduate work in Classics, and to all kinds
of entry-level employment.
Departmental Honors

A student may be recommended for program honors by vote of the
program based on the student’s course work.
Minor Program

The program has three minors: Classics, Latin, and Classical
Civilization. The minor in Classics combines language study and
civilization courses (with a minimum of two courses in the languages).
The minor in Latin focuses exclusively on the study of Latin. For the
minor in Classical Civilization, students may take any combination of
courses in Classical Civilization (any courses designated CLSS). All

the minors require a minimum of 16 credits. The program can arrange
individual courses of study. Classical Studies Minor Declaration Form

The mission of the Cognitive Science Program is to advance the
study of minds and brains, real or artificial, in all their aspects, through
research and teaching. This interdisciplinary field, encompassing
the fields of psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy,
anthropology, and neuroscience, provides excellent preparation for
life in the age of information. The program aims to instill in students a
solid grasp of the intellectual problems, frameworks, and methodologies
currently available; to provide experience exploring these through
guided research; and to foster the desire to create and disseminate new
knowledge. With this foundation, students are well prepared for a wide
variety of careers in technology, human thought and behavior, or their
interaction, or for graduate studies in Cognitive Science or any of the
contributing disciplines.
We offer an undergraduate major in Cognitive Science, an
undergraduate minor, a graduate minor, and a graduate certificate. A
Cognitive Science major is easy to combine with a second major in the
humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, or computer science.

B.A. IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE

The B.A. with a major in Cognitive Science requires a minimum of 13
courses. All majors take COGS 007, an introduction to cognitive science,
core courses in cognitive psychology, philosophy, artificial intelligence,
and cognitive neuroscience, and collaterals in computer science and
math. In a second tier, students pursue their individual interests in their
selections of major electives by completing at least five electives from
three tracks. A capstone integration occurs in the required two-semester
senior thesis (COGS 301 and COGS 399), in which students focus
on a topic of their choice spanning at least two cognitive science subdisciplines.
Additional coursework in affiliated disciplines is recommended, to be
selected in consultation with the major adviser and dependent upon
anticipated career path. These courses may fulfill college distribution
requirements. Note: A number of courses have pre-requisites.
Students considering this major should check pre-requisites and plan
accordingly. A preliminary meeting with the program director may be
useful.

The minor gives graduate students who are enrolled in Lehigh University
degree programs, such as computer science or psychology, an
opportunity to develop expertise at the intersection of information
processing by humans and intelligent machines. Graduate students
investigating mental processes or applications such as artificial
intelligence or educational technology are encouraged to participate,
with the approval of an adviser in their major program, by contacting
the Director of the Cognitive Science Program. On completion of the
program, the Director of the Cognitive Science Program will issue a
letter to the student certifying that he or she has met the requirements of
the minor.
The Graduate Minor requires five graduate level courses: the core
course COGS/PSYC 423 and four electives. At least two of the four
electives must be taken outside the student's home department.
Special topics courses with a cognitive science emphasis may also
count towards the minor, with the approval of the Cognitive Science
Program Director. Courses taken towards the minor may also fulfill
requirements of the student's major program, with the approval of the

Comparative and International Education
The Comparative and International Education (CIE) Program offers three
degrees: An M.Ed. in Globalization and Educational Change, a M.A. in
Comparative and International Education, and a Ph.D. in Comparative
and International Education. The CIE program also offers a Lehigh
graduate certificate program in International Education for Development.
Graduates completing their degree in the CIE program may move into
positions as government officials and education policy makers, research/
policy institute scientists, development program officers, or work in
various non-governmental and educational organizations either in the
United States or in countries around the world.
The Comparative and International Education (CIE) program provides
a unique blend of global community, content, interaction, context,
perspective and purpose. Highlights of these innovative qualities include:
• An international learning community. The CIE Program is a vibrant
learning community where internationalization thrives in formal
classroom instruction, as well as in daily socialization of students
and faculty in academic, professional, and personal realms. CIE
students have a unique opportunity to engage in a myriad of
international experiences as a part of their graduate education
experience, including conducting education research and evaluation
worldwide, engaging in international education development
consultancy, internships at the United Nations, and assisting in
journal/book editing in comparative and international education.
• Multiple opportunities for student/faculty interaction. CIE faculty have
extensive experience in the field as teachers and leaders, as well as
a theoretical and methodological grounding in a discipline, which is
relevant to global research and comparative educational issues. We
recognize that students bring a wealth of expertise and knowledge
that complements the faculty’s expertise and knowledge. Therefore,
the CIE program provides a framework through which students
and faculty can build professional relationships that extend beyond
the classroom, including collaborative projects, directed study, and
intellectual discourse.
• Interdisciplinary perspectives. Given that education is the product
of many converging forces from politics to society to economics
to history to business and philosophy, education and schooling

issues are too complex and diverse to be addressed by just one
disciplinary perspective. Unless we understand the various factors
impacting decisions, we cannot understand why schools in countries
halfway around the world are structured the way they are, or why
educational policies in our own communities deal with the topics
they do. Working closely with the graduate programs of Lehigh’s
College of Arts and Sciences, the CIE degree programs breach the
boundaries of disciplines, thus creating an opportunity for students to
examine education-related issues from multiple perspectives.
There are several projects that exemplify the CIE Program’s signature
and distinctive properties. They are,
• International Education and Research. CIE faculty and students
participate in research and academic exchange with colleagues
around the world. One example is through the CIE Programbased Tübingen-Lehigh International Partnership (TüLIP). Through
TüLIP, Lehigh students have the option to take either full-term
or short schedule courses taught in English at the University of
Tübingen (Germany). Research or field-work may also be taken for
Lehigh academic credit and is collaboratively supervised by both
Lehigh and Tübingen professors. One recent project connected
to TüLIP through the CIE Program is the Mountaintop Experience
called “Transitions for Refugees through Empowerment and
Education” (TREE). The TREE project unites Lehigh students,
refugee advocates and education experts in both the U.S. and
Germany to investigate the dynamic factors facing resettled refugee
youth.
• Scholarly Publication and Editing. The CIE Program is home to
two professional academic publications in the field: The Annual
Review of Comparative and International Education (ARCIE) and the
FIRE: Forum for International Research in Education. ARCIE is the
flagship academic review in the field of comparative and international
education, and is published annually. FIRE is an international, peerreviewed, open-source, online journal promoting interdisciplinary
scholarship on the use of internationally comparative data for
evidence-based and innovative change in education worldwide. CIE
faculty serve as senior editor for both publications and CIE students
serve as both editorial assistants and frequent co-authors for these
prestigious publications.
• International Development and Consulting. CIE Program faculty and
students engage in short-term development and program-related
consultancy projects on a regular basis. For example, a CIE faculty
and student team has worked with a youth village for orphaned and
vulnerable youth in post-genocide Rwanda to develop a villagewide monitoring and evaluation system. This consultancy project,
developed with the support of a CIE degree program graduate
working with the Rwandan village, involved both Lehigh-based
and Rwanda-based planning, research, workshops, and other
consultancy-related activities, and complemented graduate-level
coursework in the CIE program.

The M.A. in Comparative and International Education (CIE) guides
students in the examination of educational policy and theory on an
international level, taking into consideration the impact of global
economic, political, sociological, and historical factors on educational
systems. A focus on interdisciplinary approaches to comparative and
international education provides students a foundation for examining
both educational research and policy. Graduates are prepared to work
in educational research and policy organizations, government offices,
ministries of education, and international development organizations.
The M.A. in CIE is a 36 credit hour program comprised of 18 credit hours
of required (core) courses, 6 credit hours of electives, 12 credit hours of
disciplinary-focused courses, and 3 thesis/capstone credit hours.
The core includes foundational courses in comparative and international
education, statistics, and research. 6 credit hours of electives provide
students the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the field of
comparative and international education. The 12 credits of disciplinaryfocused coursework requires students to choose among the following
social science disciplines: sociology/anthropology, political science/
international relations, history, and economics. This disciplinary
focus builds a theoretical and methodological foundation in a social
science, which is a valued characteristic of professionals in the field of
comparative and international education. Finally, the master's thesis is
prepared under the direction of one of the core CIE faculty.

CIE 400 Comparative and International Education 3 Credits
The goal of this course is to introduce students to the origins and
development of the field of international and comparative education
and to explore how both scholars and educational policymakers have
engaged some of the debates that characterize policy and research in
education around the world. Special attention is devoted to similarities
and differences in educational policy and practice between advanced
and developing capitalist, socialist and “transitional” societies. At the
end of this course, students should be able to think about their school or
educational system within a global context, and have some idea how to
make meaningful comparisons.
CIE 401 Globalization & Contextualization 3 Credits
The goal of the course is to clarify what globalization is and to consider
the impact of globalizing ideas, structures, and cultures on education,
and how educators and other stakeholders respond given their
school’s or system’s unique global context. Through case studies and
discussions with real-world school leaders, students explore ways that
policies are “borrowed” and both educational cultures and structures are
“institutionalized.”
CIE 402 Development and Evaluation of International Educational
Projects 3 Credits
This course is an introductory exercise for students new to educational
research, program evaluation and related areas (e.g., quality
improvement, enhancing organizational performance, methods
of social change, management training). Students will develop
and conduct a professional on-site project evaluation of existing
national and international projects, including initiatives undertaken
by different international organizations (e.g., UNICEF, UNESCO,
USAID), educational institutions, and schools (both public and private).
Students will be accompanied and supervised throughout all stages
of the research and evaluation process. No previous experience
with evaluation research and empirical or qualitative data analysis is
required.

CIE 403 Globalization and Curriculum Implications 3 Credits
This course investigates the impact of globalization on curriculum. In
particular, it discusses how curriculum has historically been utilized
in nation building; how tensions between the global and the local are
inherent in curriculum; and how curriculum is a site of construction of
national as well as global/cosmopolitan identities. Global citizenship is
one of the major curricula themes spanning this dynamic intersection
between the global and the local. This course will present several
theoretical perspectives on this phenomenon and compare curricula
across nations to understand how globalizing the curricula differs
according to culture and language.
CIE 404 Issues and Institutions in International Educational
Development 3 Credits
Explores theoretical approaches to understanding the role of education
in international development by introducing students to institutions
involved in international educational development in diverse global
settings (e.g., United Nations, World Bank, NGOs, and state agencies).
Discussions are framed by current debates in the fields of international
and comparative education.
CIE 405 (WGSS 405) Experiencing the United Nations: Gender and
Education in International Development 3 Credits
Building on the Lehigh University/United Nations partnership initiative,
this course provides a structured practical experience for students to
learn about the dynamics of UN and civil society relationships, focusing
on the issues of gender and education in international development.
Class activities include trips to the UN to attend NGO briefings and
other events. Students develop experiences and skills in international
development such as policy blogging, brief writing, and education sector
analysis.
CIE 406 International Education Policy 3 Credits
Focuses on how policy is created, implemented, and evaluated in
schools and educational systems from a comparative and international
perspective. Provides a framework for a comprehensive analysis of the
education "sector" in order to inform regional, national, or multinational
educational policymaking. Students will apply this understanding to
an analysis of education policy in a specific region or district (e.g.,
Pennsylvania) from a global policymaking perspective.
CIE 407 Grant Writing and Fund Raising in International Education
Development 3 Credits
Addresses NGO issues and needs and will develop leadership, problem
solving, and practical grant writing skills focused on international
education development. The course is designed for individuals
working in international NGOs and schools and is designed to work
in conjunction with a local or international NGO. Teams of students
will develop a project proposal related to the agency’s primary service
mission, articulate a fund-raising strategy, and raise capital on the basis
of proposals developed in class.
CIE 408 Master'sThesis/Capstone 3 Credits
Master's-level course requiring an original research or a capstone
(project, paper, presentation, or a co-authored publication) related to
a relevant topic in the field of comparative and international education.
Thesis/capstone is conducted with the supervision of Comparative &
International Education program faculty.
CIE 410 Research in Comparative and International Education I 3
Credits
(Two-semester-course taught in consecutive semesters with CIE
411.) This course provides an overview of research methodologies
used in comparative and international education research. The course
will introduce doctoral students to both qualitative and quantitative
research methodologies, including participant observation, interviews,

language, class, and gender. It critically analyzes existing systems of
power and privilege that maintain the social constructions of cultural
differences in the United States and globally. Through readings and
class discussion, students are empowered to clarify and ground their
own beliefs about education equity, while articulating a vision for
equitable educational development as thoughtful, critical, and humane
education researchers and practitioners.

Distribution of HSS courses must satisfy the college requirements.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS

Graduate programs of study provide a balance between formal
classroom instruction and research and are tailored to the individual
student’s professional goals. The programs appeal to individuals
with backgrounds in computer or information science, in computer
engineering, in electrical engineering, in mathematics, or in the physical
science. Research is an essential part of the graduate program.
The research topics are listed in the departmental descriptions for

Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Electrical and Computer
Engineering (ECE) which jointly administer the computer engineering
program. Individual courses are listed in the catalog descriptions of the
CSE and ECE departments.
The Master of Science degree requires the completion of 30 credit
hours of work and may include a six credit hour thesis for Computer
Engineering degree. A program of study must be submitted in
compliance with the graduate school regulations. An oral presentation of
the thesis is required.
The Master of Engineering degree requires the completion of 30
credit hours of work, which includes design-orientated courses and
an engineering project. A program of study must be submitted in
compliance with the college rules. An oral presentation of the project is
required.
The Ph.D. degree in computer engineering requires the completion of
42 credit hours of work (including the dissertation) beyond the master's
degree (48 hours if the master's degree is not from Lehigh), the passing
of a departmental qualifying examination appropriate to each degree
within one year after entrance into the degree program, the passing
of a general examination in the candidate's area of specialization, the
admission into candidacy, and the writing and defense of a dissertation.
Competence in a foreign language is not required.
The program has a core curriculum requirement for graduate students.
The purpose of this requirement is to guarantee that all students
pursuing graduate studies in the program acquire an appropriate
breadth of knowledge of their discipline. To satisfy the core curriculum
requirements in Computer Engineering, students need to complete
at least two courses in the computer hardware/architecture area, at
least two courses in a second area, and at least one course in a third
area. In each of the three areas at least one course must be at the 400
level. The areas are: computer software systems, signal processing
and communications, computer software applications, and circuits and
systems. See www.compe.lehigh.edu for details about these areas.
Courses from other universities or undergraduate studies may be
used to satisfy these requirements, by petition, at the discretion of
the program faculty. Additional graduate program information may be
obtained from the program’s graduate coordinator.
Most courses in the Computer Engineering curriculum are listed in
the Computer Science and Engineering (p. 172) (CSE) and Electrical
and Computer Engineering (p. 203) (ECE) departments.

Computer Science and Business Program
The College of Business and Economics and the Computer Science and
Engineering department in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and
Applied Science jointly offer the Computer Science and Business (CSB)
program. The mission of the program is to provide rigorous computer
science education integrated with in-depth business training that
prepares high quality undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds
for lifelong learning and to assume positions of leadership in the
business community. This carefully crafted 136 credit hour degree
integrates technology skills in software development with a solid
background in business and economics. Deep immersion in both
of these areas distinguishes CSB from programs offered by other
universities. At the same time it is well balanced with approximately one

Lehigh University 2016-2017
2

third of the courses in liberal arts, one-third in computer science, and
one-third in business.
After four years the program leads to a degree in Computer Science
and in Business, which is jointly awarded by the College of Business
and Economics and the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and
Applied Science. Graduates of the program will be ideal candidates for
placement within public accounting firms, consulting companies, and
startup companies. This program provides students with the background
needed to become the CIO’s, decision makers, and general managers of
information age corporations.
While honors-like in quality and rigor, the CSB program is open to
any student wishing to accept the challenges it offers. Students may
matriculate at Lehigh specifically into CSB or enter the program at a later
point. Transferring into CSB after freshman year, however, may require
students to take additional credits to graduate. The CSB program is
accredited in Business (AACSB International) and is accredited by The
Computer Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.
The co-directors of the CSB program are James A. Hall, Peter
E. Bennett Chair in Business and Economics (jah0@lehigh.edu)
and Henry Korth, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering
( hfk2@lehigh.edu).

Such that one course has an attached laboratory and such that two courses
are in a laboratory science with the first course a prerequisite to the second
course. Note that there are some NS courses that, though in a laboratory
science, do not include a laboratory; instead the "attached lab" has a
separate course number. See Suggested Sequences of Natural Science

CSB TRACKS

Students may choose to use their CSB professional electives to develop
areas of concentrations or tracks from courses offered within the CSE
department or CBE. In certain cases, the program co-directors may also
approve courses from other departments. See some examples of CSB
tracks (http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/academics/undergraduate-computerscience/bs-in-computer-science-and-business/2-uncategorised/122-csbtracks). Note: that it is not required that a student complete a track, just
that students fulfill the 9-credit professional elective requirement.
SAMPLE SEQUENCES OF COURSES

Below are several sample course sequences that fulfill the CSB degree
requirements. These are only examples and nothing here is intended
to suggest implicit requirements. It should be clear in particular that
electives can easily be rearranged. All sample sequences assume a

Samples A and B are shown in two versions: Samples A1 and B1
assume MATH 021 in the fall of freshman year. Samples A2 and B2
assume that MATH 021 is replaced by the sequence of MATH 075
in the fall and MATH 076 in the spring with MATH 022 deferred until
sophomore year.

First Semester

Students contemplating the Lehigh in Prague Program during the
summer following their sophomore year should complete ACCT 151and
ACCT 152, CSB 311, and CSE 241 (or CSE 341) by the end of
sophomore year. (See Samples B1 and B2). It is necessary to request
an override to be allowed to take ACCT 152 concurrent with CSB 311.
Students not planning to go to Prague, or who plan to go in the summer
following their junior year should take CSB 311 in the spring of junior
year.
Students contemplating graduate study in computer science or
employment at major computing software firms (e.g. Microsoft, Google,
Oracle, IBM) should consider taking CSE 340 prior to senior year. (See
Sample C).
Sample D shows how a student entering CSB as a sophomore from the
P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science could complete
the CSB major in 4 years with overloads in senior year. The overloads
can be avoided via AP credit, a summer course, or the Lehigh in Prague
program. It is important that students considering a transfer into CSB
contact Professor James Hall or Professor Hank Korth prior to course
registration.
Sample E shows how a student entering CSB as a sophomore from the
College of Business and Economics could complete the CSB major in 4
years without overloads (but see note regarding Math). It is important
that students considering a transfer into CSB contact Professor James
Hall or Professor Hank Korth prior to course registration.

Note that most HU courses are 4 credits and the credits beyond the total of 6
needed contribute towards satisfying the free elective.
The ECO 045 alternative is not recommended for students targeting CS
graduate study.
CSE 341 is a better choice for students targeting CS graduate study than
CSE 241.
Free elective, but this covered by any HU credits beyond the 2 listed above.
400-level CSE courses not needed for an undergraduate program can be
applied to a Lehigh graduate program via petition.
CSB requires MATH 021 rather than MATH 081. However, if you earned
at least a B in MATH 081 you may (if you wish) request permission from
the Math Department to go directly into MATH 022. If the Math Department
grants that permission, and you complete MATH 022 with at least a C-, the
CSB program will accept your MATH 081 course in place of MATH 021. The
sample sequence assumes you get permission to go directly to MATH 022.
Without that permission, unless you have AP credits, you will need to
overload at least one semester or get course credits during the summer.

Computer Science and Engineering
The department of computer science and engineering (CSE) offers
undergraduate and graduate programs of study in computer science,
computer science and business, and computer engineering, along
with research opportunities in these fields. Computer science is the
study of computer algorithms, software systems, and the effective
use of computers to solve real-world problems and to develop new
applications. Computer engineering is the study of how to develop
new computer systems and how to integrate computers with electronic
devices. Lehigh’s majors prepare students for graduate school or for
any of the different careers in computer science, computer engineering
or computer systems analysis. Computer science and computer
engineering and their related careers represent, in the US workplace,
the largest field of engineering larger than all others, including electrical
engineering, combined. More discussion on the career potential, as
well as the most up to date course offerings can be found on our
departmental web site, www.cse.lehigh.edu.
Lehigh University offers a bachelor of science degree in computer
science from the P. C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied
Science; the bachelor of science degree in computer science, and the
bachelor of arts degree with a major in computer science, from the
College of Arts and Sciences; and a bachelor of science in Computer
Science and Business, jointly supported by the P.C. Rossin College
of Engineering and Applied Science and the College of Business and
Economics. A minor in computer science is available except to students
majoring in computer engineering, computer science or computer
science and business. Graduate study in the department leads to
the degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.)
in computer science. In conjunction with the department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering (ECE), a bachelor of science degree in
computer engineering and the master of science and Ph.D. degrees
in computer engineering are also offered in the P.C. Rossin College
of Engineering and Applied Science. In conjunction with the College
of Business and Economics, the CSE department also takes part in
the masters of business and engineering (MB&E) program and in the
integrated business and engineering major. Except for the Bachelor of
Arts degree, each of the above programs is accredited by the Computer
Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc.,www.ABET.org.
The undergraduate programs emphasize the fundamental aspects of
their respective areas, with extensive hands-on experiences for the
students. Electives permit students to tailor their programs according to
their interests and goals, whether they be in preparation for graduate
study or entry into industry. The department highly recommends that
students give focus to their electives by following one of the tracks
listed in the department website at www.cse.lehigh.edu/TRACKS.
Students have the opportunity to synthesize and apply their knowledge
in a senior design project. Students are encouraged to become
involved in the many research projects within the department, and may
use independent study courses and their senior project as a way to
participate while receiving course credit.
The graduate programs enable students to deepen their professional
knowledge, understanding, and capability within their subspecialties.
Each graduate student develops a program of study in consultation with
his or her graduate advisor. Key thrust areas in the department include:
Computer Systems Engineering: computer architecture, sensor
networks, robotics, mobile and wearable computing, and networking.
Software Systems Engineering: software architectures, parallel and
distributed computing, object-oriented soft ware, middleware, Webbased systems and networked software systems.
Information Systems Engineering: database, data mining,
bioinformatics, computer graphics, optimization, multimedia systems,
expert systems, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.
Both graduate and undergraduate research are encouraged. The
department maintains a number of computer laboratories in support
of computer science and computer engineering. The department has
research laboratories in robotics, networking, image processing, artificial
intelligence, security, and web mining. These laboratories and their
associated research activities are described more completely in the

Lehigh University 2016-2017

departmental web site (www.cse.lehigh.edu). While these laboratories
are research oriented, they are also used for undergraduate projects.

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS

Computer laboratory usage is an essential part of the student’s
education. The primary department resources include a network of more
than 60 workstations, file servers, and compute servers running the Unix
operating system. These systems provide an array of software tools
for our students and researchers including programming languages (C,
C++, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Matlab, etc.), software development
tools, software and hardware simulators, and computer-aided design
packages. One of our teaching labs contains workstations specifically
designed for flexibility in running different operating systems so that
students can become system administrators, network defenders, or
designers of high-performance code utilizing graphical processing units
(GPUs) within a controlled environment.

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

The department’s computers are connected via gigabit Ethernet
to the university’s backbone network. The university is connected
through multiple high-capacity connections to the Internet as well as
a connection to Internet2. Neither the department nor the university
requires a student to own a personal computer. In addition to the
departmental resources, the university provides campus-wide
wireless network access, public sites containing hundreds of PCs
and Macintoshes, multiple large-capacity compute servers, and most
classrooms are equipped with a PC and a video projection system.

See catalog entry for Computer Science and Business (p. 166).
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree programs are
available to students through either the College of Arts and Sciences
or the P. C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. Both
programs are accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission
of ABET (http://www.abet.org). The two programs are identical in the
fundamental requirements in mathematics and computer science, and
the programs are appropriate for entry into management or industrial
positions. They are also appropriate for continued graduate study,
though students considering graduate study are strongly encouraged to
consider taking part in a research project during their junior year. The
two BS programs differ in their non-computer science content in that
the students must fulfill the distribution requirements of the respective
college.
The required courses for the degrees contain the fundamentals of
discrete mathematics, structured programming, algorithms, computer
architecture, compiler design, operating systems, and programming
languages. A strong foundation in mathematics is required. Because
many courses are frequently offered, there are many sequences in
which courses may be taken to satisfy the requirements. Below are the
requirements for the B.S. degrees. See www.cse.lehigh.edu/COURSES
for links to sample sequences and for a list of all CSE courses, their
prerequisites, and when they are offered.

The Ph.D. degree in computer science requires the completion of 42
credit hours of work (including the dissertation) beyond the master's
degree (48 hours if the master's degree is not from Lehigh), the passing
of departmental qualifying requirements appropriate to each degree
within one year after entrance into the degree program, the admission
into candidacy, the passing of a general examination in the candidate's

Lehigh University 2016-2017

area of specialization, and the writing and defense of a dissertation.
Competence in a foreign language is not required.
The CSE department has a core curriculum requirement for graduate
students in each of the degree programs. The purpose of this
requirement is to guarantee that all students pursuing graduate studies
in the department acquire an appropriate breadth of knowledge of their
discipline.
Computer Science: PhD students in the CS program must satisfy a
"Graduate Breadth" requirement which involves taking, in addition to
the four mandated first-year courses, another four regular graduatelevel courses in Computer Science and Engineering or a closely related
subject. Courses appropriate to the student's educational objectives
should be selected in consultation with the student's advisor. The plan
must be approved by the advisor, the Director of Graduate Studies for
CSE, and the Chair of the CSE Department. To satisfy the requirement,
courses must be at the 400-level and may not be research, independent
study, experimental, or special topics courses (for example, courses
numbered CSE 450 or CSE 49X will not satisfy the requirement).
This new requirement applies to CS students entering the Ph.D.
program in Fall 2010 or later (i.e., those who fall under the new rules
regarding the first-year curriculum). For details on these requirements,
see the department’s web site www.cse.lehigh.edu.
Courses from other universities or undergraduate studies may be
used to satisfy these requirements, by petition, at the discretion of the
department faculty. Additional graduate program information may be
obtained from the department’s graduate coordinator.

Counseling Psychology
The Counseling Psychology program offers 4 degrees: M.Ed. (and
certification) in School Counseling (48 credits); M.Ed. in Counseling
and Human Services (60 credits); M.Ed. in International Counseling (30
credits); and Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. The program also offers
a Lehigh graduate certificate in International Counseling.
The M.Ed. in School Counseling is approved for certification (pre-K-12)
by the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE); the M.Ed. program
in Counseling and Human Services is accredited by the Master’s in
Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC), and the

179

Ph.D. program is accredited by the American Psychological Association
(APA).
Our counseling psychology programs (Ph.D. and M.Ed. in Counseling
and Human Services) adhere to The Benchmark Competencies for
Professional Psychology (Campbell, Fouad, Grus, Hatcher, Leahy, &
McCutcheon, 2013). The M.Ed. Program in School Counseling adheres
to the PDE competencies for pre-K-12 School Counselors.
Counseling Psychology prepares students as competent and
effective scientist-practitioners who demonstrate and strive for selfawareness, knowledge, and skills, undergirded by an attentiveness and
responsiveness to multiculturalism and social justice.
Students who complete the M.Ed. in School or International Counseling
typically seek positions in public, private, and international educational
settings as school counselors. Students who complete the M.Ed. in
Counseling and Human Services seek a variety of positions, including
community and agency counseling, independent practice, doctorallevel work, business and industry, and they often seek LPC licensure.
Students completing the Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology typically
seek positions as professional psychologists in hospitals and mental
health centers, university counseling centers, independent practice,
government positions (for example, Veterans Administration, public
health) or as university professors.
Students and faculty are active in local communities, doing research in
a major NIH-funded project on maternal child attachment and emotional
regulation, and in working with inner city adolescents in the Lehigh
Valley. The Counseling Psychology program also runs a summer
institute on international counseling and conducts training of counselors
globally. In addition, the Community Voices Clinic (CVC) is a schoolbased integrated mental health clinic, located at Broughal Middle and
Donegan Elementary Schools, that provides mental health services to
uninsured and underinsured families and communities in Southside
Bethlehem. Many of our students co-publish and co-present nationally
with faculty members.

Doctor of Philosophy in Counseling Psychology

Currently, the doctoral program requires a total of 103 credits, which
are composed of 30 master's level credits plus 70 doctoral level credits.
A student who enters the counseling psychology doctoral program
already holding a master's degree, regardless of where the degree was
obtained, may be exempted by her or his advisor from taking up to a
total of the 30 credits of required master's level coursework, with the
exemption granted based on a review of the student’s transcript and/
or course syllabi to ensure that the course or courses were of similar
content to the course offered by Lehigh. These exempted credits do
count toward the total needed for the doctoral degree (currently 103),
but will not appear on the student’s Lehigh transcript. After conferring
with his or her advisor, the student will complete an internal petition to
have these credits exempted, and this petition must be approved by the
program director.

After the student has completed the first 15 hours of graduate work, the
student is specifically reviewed for full admission. This review is completed
during the annual review process for any student who has completed 15
hours. The student's coursework and performance and progress in the
doctoral program are reviewed by the faculty. Any questions about the
student's progress and plans are raised and discussed, and a vote is then
taken to admit the student. The College of Education then writes a letter of
admittance to the student specifying the time line for completion of all degree
requirements. Students entering with a bachelor’s degree have 10 years to
complete all degree requirements. Students entering with a master's degree
have 7 years to complete all degree requirements
The purpose of the doctoral qualifying research project is to demonstrate
research competence and to lay the groundwork for the student's
dissertation. The doctoral qualifying project must be completed before
application for the pre-doctoral internship can be approved. The project
is research undertaken by the student in consultation with the research
advisor and is presented in two forms:
1. A written manuscript in APA (6th edition) format in a condition suitable for
submission in a professional journal (with one variance; see below). Acceptance
for publication is not required to meet this requirement, but it is expected that
research projects will be submitted for publication in a timely fashion following
completion.
2. Presentation of the project at a public colloquium.

Prior to, and including the semester in which a proposal is approved,
students must register for 3 dissertation credits each fall and spring semester.
Similarly, for the semester(s) following the approval of the dissertation
proposal, students must take 1 maintenance of candidacy credit up until,
and including, the semester in which the dissertation is defended. The only
exception to this policy is during the time the student is on internship, during
which only internship credits need to be taken. The matter of taking these
dissertation credits should be taken seriously. Students who do not follow this
procedure, and take fewer credits than required, will find that they will not be
able to graduate until back-credits are paid for.

Earth and Environmental Sciences
The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES) is Lehigh’s
home for teaching and research in the areas of ecology, environmental
science, and geological sciences. Matters of environmental quality and
natural resources will increasingly impact people and society in the
years to come, and the EES department offers a range of undergraduate
and graduate programs that provide students with an understanding of
Earth’s biosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere, with an
emphasis on how these components function as an integrated Earth
system. Training in Earth and Environmental Sciences can lead to
technical and scientific careers in research, environmental consulting,
conservation ecology, government agencies, and the petroleum industry,
and can also serve as an excellent liberal arts degree that provides
context and preparation for careers such as law, policy, journalism and
economics.
Faculty in the EES department have a wide range of interests and
strong reputations in the fields of geology, ecology, and environmental
sciences. In instruction at all levels, the department emphasizes field
experiences, laboratory techniques, and experiential learning, as well
as the development of quantitative and communication skills. The EES
department maintains a relaxed and personal atmosphere in which
students can interact with faculty in many ways, including seminars,
special symposia on topics of the students’ choice, field research, and
departmental field trips.
EES is a core department in the Environmental Initiative Program
(EI), which offers students access to interdisciplinary training in
Environmental Science, Engineering, and Policy.
At the undergraduate level, students may choose from a B.A. or a
B.S. degree in Earth and Environmental Sciences. The flexible B.A.
program provides students an opportunity to acquire breadth, design

Lehigh University 2016-2017

a specialized program, or find room for a double major. A popular
choice is a double major in Earth and Environmental Sciences and
in Environmental Studies, a major offered through the Environmental
Initiative (http://www.ei.lehigh.edu). This degree is well suited to students
with career aspirations in areas such as engineering, environmental law,
journalism, economics, government, among many other possibilities.
The B.S. degree, while still offering considerable flexibility, provides
the more in-depth technical training required for graduate school and
scientific careers, and is well suited for students seeking science
graduate degrees or employment as professionals in the earth and
environmental sciences.
An accessible minor program is available for students wishing to add
Earth and Environmental Science insight into any number of other
technical or non-technical degree programs, helping students distinguish
themselves as they prepare to enter today’s fast-evolving job markets
and graduate programs.
For students with strong interests in areas such as hydrology, water
and soil remediation, hazards and associated geotechnical strategies,
EES, in conjunction with the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering (CEE), offers a five-year program leading to dual B.S.
degrees in EES and CEE (students having these interests may also
want to see the description of the B.S. in Environmental Engineering
in the catalog entry for the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering).
EES offers graduate training leading to either M.S. or Ph.D. in Earth and
Environmental Sciences. The EES graduate program is marked by close
faculty-student collaboration. Graduate students can take advantage of
strong externally funded faculty research programs and the extensive
analytical and computing facilities available in the department; these
facilities and specific EES research programs are described in some
detail on the EES departmental web page at www.ees.lehigh.edu.
FIELD WORK AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING

Field experiences are a hallmark of the EES undergraduate program.
The goal of these experiences is to place students into learning
environments that are distinct from the classroom or lab, where all
the complexities and subtleties of the field can be appreciated in their
natural setting. The Department runs a nationally recognized ~5 week
long (6 credit) summer field camp in the Rocky Mountains, which offers
intense field training in hydrology, geology, and field methods including
computer-based mapping. As part of the Lehigh in Costa Rica Program,
the Department teaches a field course in Costa Rica every winter
term that focuses on tropical ecology and natural history. Students
can participate in the department’s longstanding research programs in
limnological and ecological research in the Pocono Lakes region and
in the Lehigh River watershed. Supervised internships allow students
at all levels to become engaged in projects involving cross-disciplinary
research, assessment, and consulting work. Undergraduate students
can also become involved in forefront research programs. In recent
years, students have played a role in research in the Himalaya, Alaska,
California, Idaho, Argentina, and Italy, in addition to more nearby sites
in the mid-Atlantic states. We strongly encourage all EES majors to
take advantage of the special field programs and opportunities made
available by the department. Most EES courses also include field
experiences in the form of one-day or weekend-long field trips, and
several courses include weekly or bi-weekly field trips.

DEPARTMENT HONORS IN EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES

Students in either the B.A. or B.S. degree programs may undertake a
program that leads to graduation with department honors. To participate,
the student must (1) have a minimum major GPA of 3.4 and an overall
cumulative GPA of 3.0 expected at graduation, (2) complete at least four
credits of EES 393 (Supervised Research in Earth and Environmental
Sciences), and (3) prepare a written honors thesis on the EES 393
research project. To graduate with honors students should (1) file a
written request with the EES undergraduate instruction coordinator no
later than the beginning of the senior year (preferably during the junior
year), (2) constitute an advisory committee of two EES faculty plus
the student’s research supervisor to guide the research, (3) prepare
a research proposal for committee’s approval, and (4) give an oral
presentation of research results and conclusions at a department
seminar on or before the last day of classes in the second semester of
the senior year. The committee should approve the research proposal
and the honors thesis by signing the required form and cover sheet,
which will be filed with the Department.
CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND EARTH AND
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES

This program is designed for students interested in combining programs
in two departments: Civil & Environmental Engineering and Earth &
Environmental Sciences, leading to two bachelor of science degrees,
a civil and environmental engineering B.S. degree and a B.S. degree
in earth and environmental sciences. Both degrees would be awarded
at the end of the fifth year. This program is one of the dual degree
programs mentioned in the Five-Year Programs section. The student
will have a primary advisor in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering
and Applied Sciences and a secondary advisor in the College of Arts
and Sciences. The program provides alternatives for students who may
decide not to complete the dual-degree program. Students who make
this decision prior to the beginning of the fourth year may qualify at the
end of that year for the bachelor of science in civil or environmental
engineering, as well as a minor in earth and environmental sciences.
Also, if a student decides after two years to pursue only a B.S. degree
in the EES department, it is possible to complete the requirements in
four years. If the decision to work toward this degree is made during
the fourth year, at least one additional semester is required to qualify
for either B.S. degree. Interested students should consult with the
respective departmental advisors to create a schedule of courses to
resolve conflicts or if a specified course is not offered that semester.
Required courses and major electives for the EES B.S. degree are listed
in the catalog entry for EES. Crosslisted EES/CEE courses used to
satisfy Civil Engineering Approved Electives can reduce the individual
semester and total program credits when chosen to satisfy EES program
requirements. The dual degree, and a suggested schedule of courses,
is described more fully elsewhere in the catalog (p. 154). Additional
useful information can be found on the web sites (www.lehigh.edu/
~incee/ and www.ees.lehigh.edu).
GRADUATE STUDIES

28

The Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences offers graduate
programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental
Sciences. These degrees emphasize what we feel is an important and
growing trend in ecology, environmental science, and geology, namely
the blending of expertise and perspectives from many disciplines.
Research is an integral component of all EES graduate programs and
leads to an M.S. thesis or Ph.D. dissertation prepared under a research
supervisory committee and chaired by a departmental faculty research

Lehigh University 2016-2017

advisor. An advising commitment by one or more faculty members is
required for graduate admission.
The University has outlined the general academic requirements for M.S.
and Ph.D. students in its Graduate Student Handbook, and EES has
additional Departmental requirements that must also be fulfilled. It is
the student’s responsibility to insure that all graduation requirements
are met. All graduate students work with an advisor who chairs the
student’s research supervisory committee. Graduate students make
annual presentations of their research to the Department. All graduate
students are required to take one of the Department’s four graduate core
courses (EES 411, EES 415, EES 426, and EES 484) and five additional
courses (15 credits) at the 400-level. M.S. students complete 30 credits
of coursework and thesis research and orally defend a written thesis that
encompasses the findings and conclusions of their research. Candidates
for the Ph.D. must first pass the qualification evaluation in the first year,
then defend their dissertation proposal in the General Exam, and finally,
orally defend a dissertation. For more details beyond this brief summary,
please see the graduate handbook online at: www.ees.lehigh.edu/

Williams Hall, 31 Williams Drive
The Eckardt Scholars Program is a highly selective and unique honors
program in the College of Arts and Sciences. The program emphasizes
deep intellectual curiosity, independent work, and close mentoring
relationships between the very highest achieving students and faculty at
Lehigh. Students in the program are exempt from the Arts & Sciences
distribution requirements and work with their major advisor and the
Eckardt Scholars Program Director to create a flexible course of study
that best suits their academic interests and ambitions. Although exempt
from Arts and Sciences distribution requirements, students will complete
the requisite number of credits for their degrees and all correlative
requirements for their departmental or interdisciplinary majors. The
program includes participation in two Eckardt Scholar Seminars, and
completion of a large independent project (in the form of a thesis, artistic
creation, or other capstone experience) during the senior year.
For program requirements, see Eckardt Scholars Program (p. 53).

Economics
Though economics is variously defined, modern-day definitions
generally suggest that it is the study of the principles that govern the
efficient allocation of resources. One of the greatest of the 19th century
economists who did much to uncover these principles suggested a
broader definition. Alfred Marshall described economics as “a study of
mankind in the ordinary business of life and a part of the study of man.”
This dual nature of economics, technical and humanistic, is reflected in
the fact that at Lehigh the economics major is available to students in
the College of Arts and Sciences as well as in the College of Business
and Economics.

Educational Leadership
The Educational Leadership program offers a master’s (M.Ed.) and a
doctoral degree (Ed.D.), both in Educational Leadership. The program
also offers K-12 Principal, Supervisor of Curriculum and Instruction, and
Superintendent (Pennsylvania Letter of Eligibility) certification through
the state of Pennsylvania.
The Educational Leadership program is approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education (PDE). Thus, graduates of our approved
preparation programs are eligible for state certification.
Our graduates typically assume positions as superintendents, principals,
assistant principals, and directors of pupil services, special education,
and curriculum and instruction. Some of our graduates are now faculty
members in universities where they teach and conduct research.
Internationally, our graduates lead schools around the world (for
example, in China, Columbia, Italy, and The Middle East).
The Educational Leadership program has a unique blend of both theory
and practice, and a long history of excellence and high quality. In

199

addition, through Lehigh’s partnerships and programming, students
may have the opportunity to take coursework with peers who work in
international schools, bringing a different perspective to their classes.
Further, this program has a history of strong commitment to improving
educational opportunities for all students. This is evident in the practices
of our many graduates who now hold leadership positions in schools and
districts in the local area, region, nation and throughout the world.
The International School Leadership Program offers educational
opportunities at the master’s and doctoral level to people interested in
leadership in the international school community.
The Urban Principals Academy at Lehigh (U*PAL) program is designed
to develop urban school leaders who will think and act in ways that
disrupt the stagnation and mediocrity that exists in too many of our
nation’s schools. This cohort-based program utilizes the underlying
themes of creativity and imagination in leadership to address issues of
diversity and organizational culture.
The Allentown Principal Leadership Initiative (APLI, pronounced “apply”)
focuses on all the current principals and assistant principals, as well
as future school administrators, in the Allentown School District (ASD).
The program actively recruits exemplary teachers who demonstrate
the key attributes for successful turnaround leadership: instructional
leadership focused on results, influencing for performance, problem
solving, and personal effectiveness. These aspiring leaders participate
in a collaboratively designed and individually tailored graduate-level
program (at Lehigh University) that includes a full-time yearlong
internship in preparation for principal and assistant principal positions in
the most at-risk schools in the district. In tandem, current ASD school
leaders participate in professional development to promote consistent
turnaround leadership practices across the district, and to maintain longterm and sustainable change.

Electrical and Computer Engineering
The department of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) offers
undergraduate and graduate programs of study along with supporting
research for students interested in the field of electrical engineering. It
also jointly supports undergraduate and graduate programs in computer
engineering, and computer science with the computer science and
engineering (CSE) department. Graduate study leads to the degrees,
master of science, master of engineering, and doctor of philosophy
in electrical engineering, and the master of science and doctor of
philosophy in computer engineering.
The undergraduate programs emphasize the fundamental aspects of
their respective areas. Engineering design concepts are introduced
early in the curriculum, and required instructional laboratories introduce
design as a hands-on activity. Electives permit students to tailor their
programs according to their interests and goals, whether they be in
preparation for graduate study or entry into industry. Students are free
to select courses offered by other departments and are encouraged
to do so when appropriate. In this way they can prepare themselves
for activities which straddle departmental boundaries or for entry into
professional schools such as medicine or management. Students have
the opportunity to synthesize and apply their knowledge in a senior
design project. Students may use the senior design project as a way to
participate in the various research projects in the department.
The department maintains a number of laboratories in support of its
curricular programs. These laboratories include the sophomore and
junior lab electronic circuits and systems laboratory, microcomputer
laboratory, electromechanics laboratory, digital signal processing
laboratory, digital systems laboratory and senior projects laboratories.
The department has research laboratories in computer architectures,
wireless communications, optoelectronics, compound semiconductors,
electron device physics, microelectronics fabrication, signal processing,

204

Electrical and Computer Engineering

and communications. These laboratories, among others, are available
for undergraduate projects.
The graduate programs allow students to deepen their professional
knowledge, understanding, and capability within their subspecialties.
Each graduate student develops a program of study in consultation with
his or her graduate advisor. Key research thrust areas in the department
include:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Microelectronics and Nanotechnology.
Wireless Communications and Networking.
Optoelectronics.
Bio-Engineering.

Graduate research is encouraged in these and other areas.
Computers and computer usage are an essential part of the student’s
environment. The university provides a distributed network of about
75 high-performance workstations and over 300 PC-compatible
microcomputers in public sites throughout the campus. The ECE
department, in conjunction with the CSE department, has stateof-the-art systems to augment and extend the generally available
university systems. A primary resource is a network of more than
60 Sun workstations, file servers, and compute servers, running the
Unix operating system. In addition, the ECE department has a 16
node cluster that is used for high performance computing. Additional
resources to facilitate learning are the approximately 90 workstations
running the Microsoft and Linux platforms that are located in the various
ECE teaching labs. These systems provide an array of software tools
for students and researchers, such as Cadence, Freescale, Agilent Data
Systems software, Silvaco, VPI, Matlab, and Labview. The workstations
are connected via multiple high-speed ethernet, fiber optic, and ATM
networks, which are in turn connected to the university’s backbone
network, and to the external world through Internet 2. Students are
not required by the department, nor the university, to own a personal
computer, but many find such a tool a valuable asset.
A detailed description of the curricular programs follows with a listing
of the required courses and with a listing of the departmental course
offerings. The departmental courses carry the prefix ECE for electrical
and computer engineering. Courses given by the Computer Science
and Engineering department have the prefix CSE. Students are urged to
search both listings for courses appropriate to their career goals.

MASTER OF ENGINEERING IN ENERGY SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

For students with B.S. degrees in engineering, physics, computer
science or mathematics, Lehigh’s 10-month, 30-credit professional
Master’s program in energy systems engineering helps students develop
into organizational and technical leaders in the energy and power
industries. Learning takes place in an environment where potential
employers actively guide curricular development and student research
endeavors. Graduates of this program emerge with the skills and
confidence to tackle the grand challenges facing the global energy
infrastructure and its associated effect on the environment.
The hallmark of the program is student immersion in hands-on, industrydriven projects. Each student will apply advanced technical knowledge
and skills and work collaboratively with a team of faculty, fellow students,
and representatives from sponsor firms to complete a project of impact
and significance in the field — a real project as conceptualized by the
project’s sponsoring researcher or industry concern. The development
of targeted research projects serves as an entry point into the field for
talented young innovators, and a source for firms to explore new skill
sets and solutions required for success with emerging technologies and
approaches.

UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN ENGLISH

The Department of English has developed a focus on Literature and
Social Justice, the outcome of a multi-year effort to revitalize the
traditional period-based approach to literary studies. Our classes foster
a series of related activities: an exploration of how studying literature
contributes to questions of social justice; an immersion in historical
periods informed by strong theoretical commitments; and engagement
with contemporary literature and culture; and an emphasis on theorized
pedagogy, reflective practice and the scholar-teacher model. Our
faculty interact with Lehigh's varied interdisciplinary programs, including
Africana Studies; Classics; Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies;
Jewish Studies, and American Studies.
The major in English is designed to give students experience in reading
analyzing, and formulating thoughts about people and ideas that matter;
an understanding of how literary artists find the appropriate words to
express their thoughts and feelings; and a basic knowledge of the
historical development of British, American and world literature.

English

Students who major in English go on to careers in teaching, writing,
law, business, science, medicine, engineering--and many others. The
analytical and communication skills acquired in the study of literature
and writing will be of use in almost any profession or human activity.
Depending on their interests, abilities, and career plans, students
who major in English are encouraged to consider double majors or one
or two minor fields. The major in English is flexible enough to allow
cross-disciplinary study with ease. The student majoring in English
chooses from an extensive list of courses. Only one course is required
of all students, the introduction to the major, English 100. To ensure
breadth and depth of knowledge, each English major is required to take
five courses at the 300 level, typically one in each of the four historical
1
periods listed below and one as an elective. One of the five courses
must be designated as WI.

Recommendations for students pursuing honors: second-year college
competency in at least one foreign language and study abroad
experience.

A student may use a 100-level survey course in British or American
literature (123, 124, 125, or 126) to fulfill one period requirement;
however, students must still take a total of five courses at the 300-level.

PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS

Nine courses (36 credits) are the minimum for the major: ENGL 100,
five courses at the 300 level (one designated WI), and three electives (at
any level) including courses in film and one in advanced writing. Many
students elect to take additional courses, depending on their career
plans, their other majors and minors, their plans to study abroad, and
so on. Each major has a departmental advisor to assist in selecting
courses and to offer counsel about career plans.

MINORS IN ENGLISH

The department strongly recommends that any student contemplating
the possibility of advanced study of literature at the graduate level
should work toward departmental honors.

Students who anticipate becoming Presidential Scholars should speak to
the Director of Graduate Studies in their junior year.
The Department of English offers three minors, each requiring 16
hours of course work beyond English 1 and 2. Students’ major advisors
monitor the minor programs, but students should consult the minor
advisor in the Department of English when setting up a minor program.
To minor in English students take 4 courses in literature or film, one at
the 300 level.

Students enrolled in the English as a Second Language program are
expected to reach a level of competence comparable to those in the
usual freshman program. The form of instruction, however, will differ
in the ESL program by taking into account the special language and
cultural needs of non-native speakers.
Matriculating students in all the above categories who are entering at a
level above the freshman year, but who need composition credit, should
consult the department for advice.
GRADUATE WORK IN ENGLISH

The Department of English has developed a focus on Literature and
Social Justice, the outcome of a multi-year effort to revitalize the
traditional period-based approach to literary studies. Our graduate
programs provide students with skills necessary to recognize how
literature and other forms of cultural production intervene in questions of
justice and shape our conceptions of the world.
The Master of Arts Program

Candidates for the master’s degree must complete at least 33 credit
hours. Students take at least seven of the required courses at the 400
level but may select the balance of their curricula from 300-level course
offerings. Course work for the M.A. must include:
Two courses in pre-1830 literature

FILM STUDIES MINOR

Two courses in post-1830 literature

A Film Studies minor offers the opportunity to think analytically
and critically about the forms of visual culture (especially film and
television) that saturate our world. Courses offer a sustained and
coherent examination of different genres of film, film from various
national traditions, as well as recent television series that draw on the
sophisticated visual and narrative strategies of cinema.

ENGL 482, Theories of Literature and Social Justice

The minor will consist of four courses (16 credits) and will include ENGL
163 Introduction to Film and three electives, one of which may be a
course in the production of visual images or film.
Required:
• ENGL 163 (Introduction to Film) *Students must take the introductory
course prior to completing 300-level coursework
• One course focused on non-English-language film/film traditions
• 8 elective credits of coursework

matriculating freshmen will either roster ENGL 001 followed by
ENGL 002 or be enrolled in ENGL 003, followed by ENGL 005 (or
ENGL 002)

Note: the same course cannot fulfill both the core requirements except in the
case of a course that can be repeated for credit —ENGL 201, ENGL 342,
ENGL 343, and ENGL 344—which can be taken twice, once for core credit
and once as an elective.

One additional theory course
This distribution allows for some concentrated study at the master’s
level. ENGL 485 and ENGL 486, the required courses for new teaching
fellows, are not counted in the 33 credits toward the M.A. but will
be counted later toward the Ph.D., even if rostered during the M.A.
program.
The Doctor of Philosophy Program

The department admits to its doctoral program only students of proven
competence and scholarly promise. An average of 3.5 in M.A. course
work and strong endorsements from graduate instructors are minimum
requirements for acceptance.
Doctoral candidates with a Lehigh master’s degree are required to take
eight courses and register for 42 credit hours beyond the M.A. Those
entering the doctoral program with a master’s from another institution
are required to take nine courses and register for 48 credit hours.
Candidates must also demonstrate a reading knowledge of one or two
foreign languages after having agreed on choices with the director of
graduate studies.
No later than six months after completing their course work, candidates
will take written and oral examinations in one major field and two minor
fields.

220

English

Candidates write their dissertations after having their dissertation
proposals approved by the department and being admitted to candidacy
by the appropriate college.
UNDERGRADUATE COURSES

ENGL 052, ENGL 054, ENGL 056, ENGL 058, ENGL 087 and ENGL
089 are open to all undergraduates, including first-year students also
taking freshman English. Courses numbered at the 100-level are open to
students who have completed or who are exempt from the required six
hours of freshman English. First-year students who have completed with
a grade of A or A- may roster one of the 100-level courses as a second
English course to be taken concurrently with the second-semester
English composition requirement.
Prerequisites: Each course is a self-contained unit. None has any
other prerequisite than two semesters of freshman English. Thus,
students may roster ENGL 126 whether or not they have had, or ever
plan to take, ENGL 125. For all courses above 200, it is understood
that students will have completed six hours of freshman English, even
though that is not specified in the course description.
Graduate Students taking 300-level courses receive 3 credits;
undergraduates receive 4 credits.
GRADUATE COURSES IN ENGLISH

Graduate (400-level) courses are seminars, ordinarily limited to no more
than twelve graduate students, but undergraduate English majors who
are planning to go on to graduate school in English and who have shown
proficiency in the study of literature may petition to take one of these
seminars in their senior year.

The graduate Environmental Policy Design (EPD) Program at Lehigh
University provides an intensive study of policy design and analysis.
It continues to offer the concentration in Environmental Policy and
Law that has been the centerpiece of the program since its inception,
but two new concentrations in Sustainable Development and Urban
Environmental Policy have been added. These new concentrations
recognize activities that have already been underway in the EPD
program and take advantage of the expertise of new faculty who
have recently joined the College of Arts and Sciences. Students
graduating from the EPD program with the MA degree will have the
opportunity to earn a graduate certificate in one of these three subdisciplines: Environmental Policy & Law, Urban Environmental Policy,
and Sustainable Development.
The EPD program has established three separate tracks through
the master’s degree. These include the traditional thesis track, the
Community Fellows track (coursework only) and the internship track
(coursework only). The new internship track was developed to better
prepare our graduates for careers in the discipline, and takes advantage
of our relationship with a number of government and non-government
organizations, including the UN's Division for Sustainable Development
where we have placed a number of EPD students. Financial aid is
available.
Applicants for the MAEPD will be placed into one of three tracks (Thesis,
Internship or Community Fellows).

Environmental Policy Design
The M.A. in Environmental Policy Design trains scholars and
practitioners alike for the demanding task of designing environmental
policy that can protect or restore an increasingly degraded natural
environment while sustaining the benefits of economic growth and
providing for the needs of an ever-more-vulnerable (and growing)
human population. Achieving this goal will require policy professionals
to understand and analyze environmental problems amidst multiple
systems and levels of law and in the context of rapidly globalizing
governance structures, institutions, and regimes that cut across
geographical and political boundaries.

Finance
In the era of a growing competitive global economy, finance has become
increasingly important and complex. This has led to an expansion of
career opportunities within corporations, investment firms, and financial
institutions worldwide. These opportunities are varied and often overlap
with other disciplines such as accounting, economics, marketing, and
mathematics. It is also important that students engage in extracurricular
activities that might complement their academic studies.
The domestic financial services industry has been at the forefront of
global finance and will remain as one of our relative strengths within
a global economy. Lehigh, in turn, enjoys a relative advantage in this
regard as Lehigh alumni are well respected in all areas of finance. Our
program has also been able to take advantage of our proximity to many
financial institutions.

As the world becomes increasingly interdependent in commerce,
technology, and popular culture, people of different cultures must
reconcile diametrically opposed views of fairness, equity, and conduct.
Religious extremism, trade policies, human rights abuses, and gender
inequity are but a few examples of controversies born out of belief
systems colliding on the global stage. How will individuals from different
national, religious, and cultural traditions understand their personal
responsibilities in a world increasingly strained by resurging nationalism
and the pressures of globalization?
The Global Citizenship Program prepares students for engaged living
in a culturally diverse and rapidly changing world. Emphasizing critical
analysis and value reflection, the program structures educational
experiences through which students learn to negotiate international
boundaries and develop their own sense of personal, social, and
corporate responsibility to the global community. The program is
designed to be flexible so that undergraduate students in any college
may participate. Students bring perspectives of their own disciplines to
the fore as the group explores questions of what it means to be a global
citizen as an engineer, or a businessperson, or an artist or a social or
natural scientist. To participate, interested students should enroll in GCP
010 - which is a pre-requisite for application to the program - during the
Spring term of their first year at Lehigh.

Initiative in Fall 2006, and the major in Global Studies followed soon
after.
The Initiative’s three main areas of focus are Global Communication,
Culture and Identity, and Politics and Social Structures. Rooted in these
areas of interest, the major examines how the forces of globalization
shape and are shaped by history, culture, economics, art, politics,
communication, and other fundamental aspects of the human condition.
In many Global Studies programs, students choose from a sprawling
array of courses tied together by virtue of international content. Global
Studies at Lehigh directs students in a more focused manner to core
courses that confront, from the perspectives of multiple disciplines,
perhaps the single, central force shaping the world today – globalization.
The program requires a total of 40 credits, advanced language
proficiency, a semester of study abroad, and a senior seminar.
The program also takes advantage of Lehigh’s NGO (non-government
organization) status at the United Nations. Students have the opportunity
to meet and work with UN officials. A number of Global students become
delegates to the UN for international NGOs while they are still at Lehigh.
Careers in Global Studies

Career opportunities are numerous for graduates of Global Studies.
st
Professions in the 21 century increasingly are demanding global
understanding and expertise as well as the ability to take on
interdisciplinary work across boundaries. People trained in the
interdisciplinary field of Global Studies have increasing advantages
over those trained in a single discipline.
Through the Global Studies major, students acquire a strong grounding
in global affairs and an understanding of the complex phenomenon
of globalization. They engage in problem-solving across boundaries
and cultures. They are able to critically and analytically evaluate
information from a comparative perspective. They learn to be effective
communicators and learn to argue and defend complex views in writing,
such as policy papers, and public speaking, such as individual and
group presentations, to a variety of global audiences.

Lehigh’s Global Studies graduates have gone on to work for employers
in the areas of business and finance (Credit Suisse First Boston, Edward
Jones, Goldman Sachs, IBM Consulting, JP Morgan), media (A&E
Networks, Getty Images, Hearst Magazines, News China, Viacom New
Media), and nonprofits and the public sector (Habitat for Humanity,

relations, and health care.

Yet, the origins, history, evolution, and impact of globalization – even
its very definition – are subject to intense debate. We can surely say,
however, that every student leaving college and entering the workforce –
the world – should have a fundamental understanding of globalization.
Such understanding will give students crucial knowledge and skills
that will set them apart in this new world and help them succeed in an
increasingly globalized context. It will help them anticipate the social,
cultural, economic and political changes brought about by globalization
— and the resistance to globalization. It will better prepare students to
draw connections in an interdependent and interconnected world.
Global Studies is a relatively new and increasingly popular major at
universities worldwide, including Yale, UCLA, the London School
of Economics and others. Different from study in an individual
department, Global Studies is emphatically interdisciplinary, with
professors from anthropology, journalism, sociology, modern languages
and literature, religion studies, political science, history, international
relations, and others. Increasingly, the most important questions cannot
be answered by one discipline but by the combined efforts of multiple
disciplines.
Although study of globalization has been conducted at Lehigh for years,
the University formally created the Globalization and Social Change

The history major introduces students to the study of the causes and
consequences of change through an examination of political, economic,
social, cultural, and intellectual developments and institutions over time.
The department's goal is to train its majors to think critically about the
events and forces that have shaped the modern world, to analyze and
interpret sources and evidence, and to view issues from a variety of
perspectives. Those skills have served students well in a wide range of
careers. Lehigh history majors have frequently gone on to law school
or to work in various areas of education, journalism, public affairs, and
business. The major also provides an excellent basis for graduate
training in a wide range of public policy fields. The department offers
a program of independent honors research under the direction of an
individual faculty member (HIST 391, HIST 392). A maximum of six
credits may be used toward this project. Normally students pursue their
research in the second semester of the junior year and the first semester
of their senior year; the project may also be undertaken during the senior
year. Students who do well on their research project will graduate with
department honors. The writing intensive requirement must be filled by a
course in the history department. For advanced placement, please see
Section I.
The department recommends that students intending to major in history
take MATH 012, Basic Statistics, to fulfill their college math requirement.

GRADUATE WORK IN HISTORY

Lehigh University has been granting advanced degrees in history for
more than seventy years. Its graduates have become university and
college professors, secondary school teachers and administrators,
museum directors, and public servants. The graduate program focuses
primarily on the areas in which the department is particularly strong in
faculty and resources, notably 1) Atlantic World and Colonial America
and 2) Modern America, including industry and technology. The
department works closely with the Lawrence Henry Gipson Institute
for Eighteenth Century Studies which sponsors yearly symposia and
provides research support for both faculty and students. The history of
technology program is closely tied to Lehigh's Science, Technology, and
Society program.
Lehigh's libraries are especially rich in materials for graduate research
in history, particularly in the fields listed above. They have an extensive
collection of scholarly periodicals and monographs. Graduate programs
provide intensive and specialized study, and the policy of limited
enrollment permits close relations between faculty and students.
Admission to graduate study in history is competitive and dependent
upon the applicant's undergraduate preparation and record,
recommendations, and Graduate Record Examination scores. Besides
general requirements for College of Arts and Sciences graduate
programs, the following special requirements apply to graduate study in
history.
Master of Arts

There are two masters programs. Under Plan I, a candidate may
earn the degree by successfully completing 27 hours of approved
course work and submitting a thesis of the length and quality that
would make it suitable for publication as a scholarly article. The paper
may build on work presented in a graduate research seminar in the
program. Candidates continuing toward a doctorate should select Plan
I. Candidates declaring Plan II take 30 hours of approved course work
and pass examinations in two fields chosen from American, British,
European, and Latin American history, and History of Technology.
Candidates in either plan are required to maintain a 3.3 average in all
graduate work.
M.A. in History with Concentration in Public History

Doctor of Philosophy

Students in the Ph.D. program in history must maintain a 3.50 average
after two semesters of study. During the second semester, doctoral
students select one major and three minor fields in which to take
comprehensive written and oral examinations. The dissertation will be
in the major field. The dissertation advisor will chair a special committee
that will oversee the student's graduate program. The other members
of the special committee will be those faculty who are examiners in the
selected fields and one professor from another department relevant
to the candidate's major field. No professor may direct more than one
field, but the direction of a field may involve two professors. An original
dissertation is required, and it must be successfully defended to the
examining committee.
All Ph.D. students must meet the University Concentrated Learning
Requirement. They must take Historical Research (401). Students who
enter the Ph.D. program with an M.A. from another university must also
take either Readings in the History of the Atlantic World (HIST 404) or
Readings in the History of Industrial America (HIST 405). Students are
encouraged to take both seminars if appropriate to their course of study.
All Ph.D. students must take at least 18 hours of directed readings
courses (400 series) beyond the M.A.
Major Fields

Major fields are Technology, Modern Britain, Colonial America,
Nineteenth Century United States, Twentieth Century United States.
(The Nineteenth and Twentieth century fields may be divided topically
rather than chronologically; for example, a Student may be examined in
labor/social history 1800-present, and in political history 1800-present.)
Minor Fields

Any of the major fields listed above may also be minor fields. Examples
of other minor fields are American Studies; Ancient History; Early
Modern Europe; Modern Europe; Latin America; Environmental History;
Japan; Public History; Science, Technology and Society studies.
Language Requirements

The student's special committee determines whether proficiency in a
foreign language or proficiency in statistical methods will be required for
the doctoral degree.

General contact information for the Humanities Center: 610-758-4649;
humanities@lehigh.edu
The humanities consider how we understand and record human
experiences. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines including
philosophy, history, literature, religion, visual arts, music, and language,
humanistic study teaches us how to think creatively and critically about
our own identities and our connections to others—whether they live
across the street or across the world, whether they lived long ago or
will live in the futures we imagine. The Humanities Center at Lehigh
University is thus vital for building community both on and beyond our
campus. The Humanities Center creates interdisciplinary intellectual
opportunities for students, faculty, and staff engaged in humanistic
inquiry across departments and programs. Through speaker series,
reading groups, conferences, an undergraduate research journal,
research grants, and informal gatherings, the Humanities Center fosters
a broad community rooted in vibrant, rigorous, and creative inquiry into
what it means and has meant to be human. The Humanities Center
hosts an annual speaker series on a theme, bringing scholars, writers,
artists, and activists to speak on a single issue. Recent themes have
included Home, Movement, Contagion, Speaking Bodies, and the
Posthumanities.
COURSE OFFERINGS

The Humanities Center hosts and sponsors the production of the Lehigh
Review, an undergraduate research journal founded in 1992 by the
Lehigh humanities faculty. Original articles range in topic and subject
across the spectrum of undergraduate study, from English to Economics
and Physics. Published annually, the entire publication process—from
reviewing submissions to editing to design and illustration—is handled
almost exclusively by undergraduate students and supervised by a
graduate student instructor.
Any scholarly articles, academic essays or book reviews written for a
Lehigh course may be submitted. The Review does not ordinarily accept
fiction or poetry.
All submissions should reflect sustained intellectual engagement in any
of Lehigh’s many fields of study. We are especially interested in essays
that draw from the content or methodology of more than one discipline.
The Review expects students to submit well-researched and well-written
works that exceed a mere synthesis of existing sources. The Review
publishes submissions which demonstrate imagination, original insight
and a mastery of the subject.
Courses

HUM 224 Lehigh Review 1-4 Credits
Students will produce the annual edition of the Lehigh Review, the
journal of undergraduate academic (nonfiction) writing. The production
tasks are divided into one 4 credit editorial board and three pass-fail
modules (reviewing, distribution, images). Students may enroll in either
the 4 credit editorial board or in one or more of the modules. Admission
is by application at the Humanities Center.

IDEAS: Integrated Degree in Engineering, Arts and
Sciences
IDEAS: INTEGRATED DEGREE IN ENGINEERING, ARTS AND
SCIENCES

Co-Directors: Bruce Thomas, Associate Professor, College of Arts and
Sciences; William Best, Professor of Practice, P.C. Rossin College of
Engineering and Applied Science
IDEAS is a four-year honors program resulting in an integrated Bachelor
of Science (BS) Degree—jointly administered by the College of Arts
and Sciences and the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied
Science.
Interdisciplinary education in the arts and sciences and engineering is
of significant value to students who will pursue a wide variety of careers.
The complex challenges and problems confronting us in the 21st century
dramatically underscore the importance of liberally educated and
technologically sophisticated individuals whose habits of thought are
thoroughly and comfortably interdisciplinary. Moreover, Lehigh is one of
a small number of universities with the resources necessary to provide
such an education. The students in this program will benefit from the
integrated strategic leveraging of strengths across college boundaries.
This program cultivates a new breed of cross-disciplinary innovators.
It provides an education that produces students well versed in dual
focus areas, one in engineering and one in the arts, humanities,
social sciences, mathematics or natural sciences. This educational
environment also cultivates a multitude of thinking styles. It is
renaissance thinking for the technological era.
Entry Requirements

1. Admitted students who have expressed an interest when applying
will be considered for the IDEAS program. Only a limited number of
students will be accepted. Students are invited to join this honors
program by invitation.
2. To remain in the IDEAS program students must maintain a 3.25
GPA. At the end of the first year, a student with a GPA below 3.25
is given two semesters to achieve a GPA of 3.25; otherwise the
student will be asked to transfer to a regular degree program.
3. Students may transfer into the IDEAS program at the end of
their first semester or year if space becomes available. A formal
application to the program must be filed and approval from the codirectors must be obtained.
4. Students who are interested in the IDEAS program should indicate
that interest when applying.
The IDEAS program is designed so that students who transfer out of the
program at the completion of the first year will still be able to complete
an arts and sciences or engineering degree in four years. The four-year
IDEAS program does not lead to an ABET accreted engineering degree.
It is possible for students to complete a BS degree in IDEAS and an
ABET accredited BS engineering degree (dual degrees) in one or two
additional semesters.

a bachelor’s degree, may also earn their teacher certification, either
alone or as part of an appropriate master’s degree.
Students seeking initial teacher certification may earn a Master of
Education in Elementary Education with PreK-4 Teacher Certification
or a Master of Education (or a Master of Arts) in Secondary Education
with Teacher Certification. Students wishing to earn dual certification in
both general education and special education may earn their master’s
degree and acquire such dual certification by completing additional
courses in Special Education. If these students wish, they may also
earn a second master’s degree. Applicable Special Education master’s
degrees include the M.Ed. in Special Education at either the elementary
level (PreK-8) or secondary level (7-12).
Courses toward initial teacher certification are taught by faculty from the
Special Education program and the Teaching, Learning, and Technology
program. Our preparation programs highlight research-based, inquiryoriented, and technology-enabled strategies to reach all learners. We
emphasize collaborative and equitable approaches to instruction and

IPRE 101 Real Estate Practicum Clerkship I 1 Credit
Just as medical school and law school students serve clerkships
as a key part of their academic preparation, ire@l students may
serve clerkships in the Real Estate Practicum. Clerkship students will
rotate among all of the groups engaged in the Real Estate Practicum
- accompanying Practicum groups on site visits, observing those
groups’ interactions with various faculty and real estate professionals,
and assisting those groups in the completion of numerous tasks.
During the fall semester, the focus of these rotations be on the
physical characteristics of the Practicum properties including design
considerations, structural integrity, floor plans, building systems and
tenant improvements. Students will also develop an understanding of
the property’s location, and how that location affects the use(s) of the
property. Finally, students will gauge the area in which the property is
located. Concurrent with these rotations, these students will reference
their Field Laboratory property that is in an earlier stage of development,
drawing a contrast between a completed property and a property under
development. Consent of instructor required.
Prerequisites: (IPRE 001 and IPRE 002)
IPRE 102 Real Estate Practicum Clerkship II 1 Credit
A continuation of the fall semester, the spring semester rotations focus

and on the financial analysis (valuation) of the Practicum properties.
Clerkship students will reference their Field Laboratory property to
contrast the difference between the demonstrated value created (in a
completed property) and the value that is expected to be created (in a
property under development).
Prerequisites: IPRE 001 or IPRE 002
IPRE 300 Apprentice Teaching 1-4 Credits

IPRE 347 Practicum in Real Estate I 2 Credits
Organized into teams, with each team assigned a different subject
commercial real property, the class engages in the study of the
physical and locational characteristics of commercial real estate as
they relate to value including: property history; architecture; physical
attributes that add to or detract from value; tenant mix; the immediate
neighborhood environment; and, the specific market in which the real
property competes for tenants. Each team meets with the property
owner and conducts a thorough review of the property’s development
process including, where applicable, previous attempts to develop the
property, prior uses for the property, and significant phase points in
the development process (for example, “deal killing” impediments that
were overcome). Each team submits a written report of their findings
and produces a 10-minute video documentary on their subject property.
Permission of the instructor required.
IPRE 348 Practicum in Real Estate II 2 Credits
A continuation of the study of the creation of value in commercial real
estate begun in the Practicum in Real Estate I. Each student team
continues with the subject commercial real property assigned to them in
Practicum I. The class engages in the study of the market and financial
characteristics of commercial real estate as they relate to value through:
a financial analysis of the market in which their property is located to
include market rents, market vacancy rates and market absorption rates;
and, financial analysis of the subject property to include both historical
results, and pro forma estimates of revenues, expenses, cash flow and
residual value. Each team also studies the financial characteristics of
comparable properties. The grand finale of the Real Estate Practicum
(and the IPRE curriculum) is the Collins Family Scholarship Competition.
Held at the conclusion of the spring semester, this competition is the
public vehicle for the Practicum teams to present the results of their
property studies. Consent of instructor required.
Prerequisites: IPRE 347

International Relations
Today's world is more interconnected than ever before: what happens
“here” affects what happens “there” and vice versa. The economic
fortunes of countries, firms, and individuals have become so sensitive
to trade, monetary, and investment decisions made elsewhere that
economic policy that is purely national has become all but impossible.
Nuclear weapons, which can kill thousands in minutes, do not respect
international boundaries; neither do the consequences of ethnic and
communal conflicts. Non-state actors, from terrorists to human rights
activists, also act across boundaries. The Internet has made it easier
than ever to form networks and political movements that span borders.
Climate everywhere is affected by environmental decisions anywhere.
st
In the 21 century, no state – not even the United States, though it
has become the first sole superpower in the history of the modern
international system– and no citizen can make important choices in a
sound manner without understanding how their decisions are shaped by
what happens outside the boundaries of their homeland; moreover, their
decisions often affect people who live far beyond those borders.
International Relations (IR) is the study of world politics in all of its
aspects: International security covers issues related to war and peace,
among and within societies. International political economy focuses on
the political dimensions of trade, investment, development, and poverty.
International law, organizations, and ethics and norms involve the study
of how legal principles and agreements and moral values contribute
to the creation of order, create the basis for stable expectations, and
regulate transactions among states and other participants in world
affairs. IR theory exposes students to the major explanatory frameworks
that have been developed for the study of international relations.
IR investigates the gamut of economic, technological, social, and cultural
and military forces that create the increasing interdependence that we
call “globalization.” IR examines the ways in which globalization and
other factors have sometimes contributed to creation of order but also
often to breakdown of order, violence among and within states, and to
assertions of particularity, whether based on ethnicity, nationalism, or
on differences in culture, or wealth. Much of IR is devoted to explaining
the behavior of states, but IR also encompasses many entities besides
sovereign states. These include international organizations (such as
the United Nations and its affiliate organizations); nongovernmental

organizations; and intergovernmental organizations, such as the
World Trade Organization, the European Union, the African Union, or
Mercosur, the Latin American trading bloc.
Lehigh University has one of the few Departments of International
Relations in the United States. At Lehigh world politics is not simply
a division of political science. The IR Department is therefore able to
offer a concentrated and multifaceted program, and one that is truly
interdisciplinary. Some IR faculty study world politics as scholars of
particular geographic regions, others as theorists seeking to explain the
major processes of world politics regardless of where and when they
occur: for instance, the causes and consequences of different forms
of warfare; the rise and decline of empires; the challenges posed by
environmental degradation; and the forces that create both wealth and
poverty. What we share is the dedication to teaching and scholarship
and the commitment to encouraging our students to engage new ideas
and to subject familiar ones to thorough scrutiny.
Judging by the number of students who choose IR as their major, it is

The Jewish studies minor, coordinated by the Philip and Muriel Berman
Center for Jewish Studies, provides students with the opportunity to
explore the history, literature, religion, and social institutions of the
Jewish people from its inception to the present. The diverse selection
of courses highlights the interaction of Judaism with other cultures and
societies in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. Students
will discover that courses in Jewish studies enhance their understanding
of individual and group identity and the dynamics of religious-cultural
pluralism. The program is designed to appeal to students with varied
interests in any field of concentration. The flexible requirements of the
minor in Jewish Studies make it an ideal compliment to any major or
minor in Arts and Sciences, Business and Economics, Engineering, or
Education. Students should coordinate their minor program in Jewish
studies with the director.
The Berman Center for Jewish Studies supplements formal course
offerings through an extensive program of lectures, colloquia, films,
field trips, and other cultural events. The Center also provides funding

Joint International Relations/Modern Languages and
Literatures Major
Program directors: IR: Chair; MLL: M.H. Chabut

The multidisciplinary Joint IR/MLL Major is offered jointly by the
Department of International Relations (IR) and the Department of
Modern Languages and Literatures (MLL). The program, which offers
a Bachelor of Arts, incorporates courses from both IR and MLL, as well
as electives from a broad cross-section of other departments, for a
challenging program that requires overseas study, language facility, and
undergraduate research.
The Joint IR/MLL Major recognizes that Lehigh graduates must be
st
adequately prepared to play and active role in the world of the 21
century. For that, they will need an acute understanding of essential
issues of global politics, broad linguistic and cultural skills, significant
overseas experience, and both intellectual and cultural sophistication.
The Joint IR/MLL Major meets those requirements with courses in
economics, international relations, language, and culture. Extended
study abroad and undergraduate research in more than one language
are also required. The program will help students develop a deeper and
richer understanding of cultural, linguistic, and political diversity around
the world.
The program requires a total of 16 courses for 60-64 credits. At least
one semester of study abroad in an approved Lehigh program is
required, as is undergraduate research that uses sources in at least one
language other than English. Each student will have two major advisors,
one each from IR and MLL.

A background in journalism, with its emphasis on research and writing,
also proves to be excellent preparation for many other fields and
provides a fine basis for the study and practice of law, graduate study
in a variety of disciplines, government service, teaching and business
management.
Students in science and environmental writing can expect to pursue
careers in science, health and environmental journalism in both the
traditional and online media; public relations for scientific societies,
environmental organizations, government agencies, universities or
hospitals; technical writing for industry and government agencies,
and other areas, such as management, administration and teaching.
The program also prepares students for graduate study in science or
environmental writing, journalism and other disciplines.
The interdisciplinary minor in mass communication will be useful to
Arts & Sciences students interested in organizational and written
communication, law, business, philosophy, government, teaching,
telecommunication or other careers where understanding of
communication is important.
Students are also eligible for scholarships and awards. Incoming high
school seniors can apply for the Rodale Scholar award, which provides a
scholarship along with opportunities at Rodale, Inc., the global publisher
of magazines, books and multimedia. Lehigh Journalism students
compete for an array of prestigious writing prizes that include the William
Prizes in Journalism, the Kachel Awards in Writing, the Cagan Award
for reporting, the Strassberg Award for research, and the Jesse Siegel
Writing Award.
Professors. Sharon M. Friedman, MA (The Pennsylvania State
University); John F. Lule, PhD (University Georgia Athens)

Journalism and Communication

Associate Professor. Kathleen K. Olson, PhD (University of North
Carolina)

The Department of Journalism and Communication offers major and
minor programs in journalism and science and environmental writing,
and a minor in mass communication.

Assistant Professors. Haiyan Jia, PhD (The Pennsylvania State
University); Jayeon Lee, PhD (Ohio State University); Jeremy J. Littau,
PhD (University of Missouri, Columbia)

Journalism is crucial to the public life of a democracy. At its best,
journalism serves as a watchdog to government, offers a voice for the
powerless at home and abroad, entertains and instructs the public,
represents the views of varied constituencies, monitors and protects the
environment and public resources, and provides a common memory for
a people.

Professors Of Practice. Imaani El-Burki, PhD (Drexel University);
Matthew Veto, MA (University of Missouri, Columbia)

The purpose of the journalism program is to provide students with the
knowledge and skills to fulfill such roles. The program emphasizes
research, writing, editing, and critical thinking and analysis. Students
integrate online technology with legal and ethical thinking and a global
perspective that will prepare them for numerous opportunities in and out
of journalism.

Understanding statistical information has become extremely important
in modern society. MATH 012, Basic Statistics, is required for students
taking a journalism or science and environmental writing major. Students
should take MATH 012 to fulfill the college's distribution requirement.
ECO 045, Statistical Methods, is an acceptable alternative. For
science/science writing double majors, calculus will be considered as a
substitute for statistics.

In the journalism major, students take courses in writing, editing, visual
communication, law and ethics, a professional internship and varied
courses in the relationship of the media with society.
A second major available to students is the science and environmental
writing program. Students learn to write about pure and applied scientific

Latin American studies is a minor program designed for students
who wish to develop an understanding of a neighboring region that
is of vital importance to the United States. Courses in anthropology,
archeology, foreign policy, history, language and literature, politics,
sociology, visual arts and museum studies, allow students to explore
various aspects of Latin American cultures and societies from an
interdisciplinary perspective. The minor contributes to a liberal arts
education by offering students an international vantage point from which
they can examine their own society and prepares them to meet the
challenges of an increasingly interdependent world. Additionally, the
unprecedented movement of peoples and ideas between the American
continents in recent decades makes the study of this region of the world
an essential component for understanding the history and culture of
the expanding U.S. Latino population. The minor in Latin American
Studies complements, therefore, major concentrations in disciplines that
have either an international or a domestic focus, and it enhances the
relevance of a Lehigh education by preparing students to be citizens of a
culturally diverse society and, more generally, of the Americas.
The Latin American Studies minor program requires 15 to 16 credit
hours of coursework. In addition to regular Lehigh offerings, students
may receive minor credit for appropriate courses at other LVAIC
institutions, study abroad programs in Latin America, and various
Lehigh faculty-led programs, such as “Lehigh in Martinique” and
“Lehigh in Costa Rica” (both offered during the winter term). Students
are encouraged to take advantage of extracurricular activities
sponsored by the Latin American Studies Program, which include guest
speakers, exhibits, films, etc. To declare a minor in Latin American
Studies, students must complete a minor declaration form (http://

The Loewy Institute continues tradition of the Institute for Metal Forming,
which was established in 1970 to teach the principles and applications
of metal forming technology to graduate and undergraduate students,
to provide instructions and equipment for graduate research in metal
forming processes, and to assist industry with solutions to problems in
metal forming.
The main objective of the institute’s research is to conduct crossdisciplinary process engineering studies to better understand and
control manufacturing processes and their impact on the microstructural
response of a material. The material microstructure developed during
processing is responsible for physical properties of the material.
Recently, classical metal forming research has been expanded to
include projects in powder processing including additive manufacturing,
microstructure characterization and analysis, as well as forming and
processing technologies for polymers, glasses, and ceramics.
The study of the forming processes encompasses physical and
numerical modeling; simulation of microstructure response to process
parameters. Computer enhanced analysis of material flow also allows
us to optimize tooling design in many manufacturing processes.
The combined quantitative results of these techniques may then be
compared with experimental data obtained from instrumented metal
forming laboratories (such as those maintained at the institute), or from
our research partners in industry.
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

Current research areas include: deformation and processing of metals,
metal and ceramic powders, glasses, polymers, light-optical and
electron-optical micro-texture characterization, tooling design and tooling
materials, thermo-mechanical processing of metals, rapid prototyping
and rapid tooling aka additive manufacturing, and machinability of the
sintered powder materials. Additionally new research projects have
been initiated in development of materials for medical and energy
applications.
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

Students interested in metal forming should refer to course offerings
in the departments of materials science and engineering, mechanical
engineering and mechanics, and industrial and manufacturing systems
engineering.

MKT 387 Marketing Strategy 3 Credits
The objective of this capstone course is to synthesize the marketing
principles introduced in other marketing courses and thus provide
students an integrative framework to marketing decision-making.
Our review indicates that this integrative closure for the marketing
coursework is a common practice at some of the better business
schools. It will focus on how marketing strategy supports the overall
corporate strategy. The course will emphasize that Marketing does
not operate in vacuum. What is done in other functional areas will
impact marketing strategy profoundly, and vice versa. The will address
traditional strategic issues such as identification of organizational
strengths, weaknesses and environmental opportunities in the context of
developing marketing strategies, but will also emphasize the importance
of embracing a customer centric orientation throughout the organization.
Incorporating a customer centric orientation is an essential component
of marketing strategy today as it captures the dynamic and evolving
nature of marketing. Every company employee is important to the
marketing function, every employee contact with a customer is a form of
marketing communication, the increasing number of customer- initiated
contacts with the firm are as important as firm-initiated contacts, and
customer relationships now take precedence over sales transactions.
Specific emphasis will be placed on applying theoretical principles in
realistic scenarios by means of case studies of how marketing strategy
is impacted by the overall corporate strategy and other functional
strategies. Student performance will be evaluated by his/her ability to
prepare and present case analyses. Senior Standing.

Materials Science and Engineering
As science and technology advance in the 21st century, progress in
many fields will depend on the discovery and development of new
materials, processed in more complex ways, and with new kinds of
properties. It is widely recognized that the progress of history has been
divided into periods characterized by the materials that mankind has
used, e.g., the stone age, the bronze age, the iron age. Today, materials
science and engineering is critical to all other fields of engineering, and
advances in other fields are often limited by advances in materials.
Interest in new materials for solid-state devices, space technology, and
superconductivity, as well as a better understanding of the behavior
of materials in the design of structures, automobiles and aircraft, plant
processing equipment, electronic devices, biomedical devices, etc.,
have increased the need for people trained in science and technology of
materials.
Education for this field of engineering requires basic studies in
mathematics, chemistry, physics and mechanics, plus a general
background in engineering principles, followed by intensive training
in the application of these principles to the development and use of
materials in a technological society.

EDUCATIONAL MISSION

B.S. IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

· Qualified graduates will be admitted to highly ranked advanced degree
programs; and

The Materials Science and Engineering undergraduate program's
mission is to provide its students an excellent education in a scholarly
environment.
PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES

· Graduates will have the knowledge and experience to pursue
successful careers;
· Graduates will meet the expectations of employers;

The undergraduate program is designed to prepare graduates for
research, development, operations, management, and sales careers
in industry or for graduate study in various specialties of the field,
including the improvement of properties in metals, ceramics, polymers,
composites, and electronic materials. While some graduates go directly
into materials-producing companies, most serve as engineers in the
transportation, electronics, chemical, communications, space, and other
industries. A number of students pursue graduate study leading to
careers in research and teaching, medicine, or the law.
Materials Science and Engineering majors have opportunities to
gain valuable experience in related fields, including other areas
of engineering or science, by choosing to concentrate elective
courses in one of these areas. Requirements for the Minor include
acquiring at least 15 course credits in that area, which may be taken
as technical or free electives in the student's major. It is particularly
straightforward for students to obtain a minor in Chemical Engineering,
in Manufacturing Engineering, in Nanotechnology, or in Polymer Science
and Engineering.
Materials Science and Engineering majors can also participate in
undergraduate research at universities in Great Britain and elsewhere
during the summer between the Junior and Senior years. The Materials
Science and Engineering Industrial Option program enables students to
gain work experience during the Senior Year. The Materials Science and
Engineering Research Option program provides senior undergraduates
with research experience.
Five-Year programs are available to broaden the Materials Science and
Engineering undergraduate experience. One such program is the ArtsEngineering Program, in which students can earn both the Bachelor of
Science degree in Materials Science and Engineering and the Bachelor
of Arts degree in some area within the College of Arts and Sciences,
such as biology, physics, chemistry, or history. Another is the B.S./M.Ed.
Program, which leads (in five years of study and internships) to the B.S.
degree in Materials Science and Engineering and a masters degree
(M.Ed.) in Education, with elementary or secondary teacher certification.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES

The department has established specific recommended programs for
the M.S., the M.Eng., and the Ph.D., emphasizing the following areas:
metals processing and performance, ceramics and glass processing and
properties, electronic and photonic materials and packaging, electron
microscopy and microstructural characterization, and archaeometallurgy.

Free Electives: 9 credit hours in any department.
Approved Elective (3 credit hours) and Engineering Science Electives
(6 credit hours) must be selected from a specific list supplied by the
Materials Science and Engineering Department. The list includes the
Industrial Option and the Research Option.

These programs are flexible and often interdisciplinary.

PROGRAM OPTIONS

Major Requirements

Recognizing that the field of materials science and engineering may
be pursued in either an industrial setting or a research setting, the
department offers three elective options to prepare students for these
careers: The Co-Op Program, the Industrial Option, and the Research
Option.

A candidate for the M.S. completes a thesis, unless fully funded by
industry, in which case a thesis is not required. M.S. thesis research
normally represents six of the 30 semester hours required for this
degree. Candidates for the M.Eng. complete a three-credit engineering
project.

Co-Op Program

A candidate for the Ph.D. prepares a preliminary program of courses
and research, providing for specialization in some field (largely through
research) in consultation with the adviser. Prior to formal establishment
of the doctoral program by the special committee and its approval by the
college, the student passes a qualifying examination that must be taken
in the first or second year of doctoral work. The department does not
require a foreign language. It does require preparation and defense of a
research proposal as a portion of the general examination.

The department's optional Co-Op program, operated within the
College of Engineering and Applied Science, provides opportunities for
integration of academic studies with significant periods of engineering
practice. The program provides eight months of paid, full-time work at
selected companies, while still allowing the student to graduate in four
years. To be considered for this program, the student should discuss
application requirements with his or her advisor.

Mathematics
Mathematics is a subject of great intrinsic power and beauty. It is the
universal language of science, and is essential for a clear and complete
understanding of virtually all phenomena. Mathematical training
prepares a student to express and analyze problems and relationships
in a logical manner in a wide variety of disciplines including the physical,
engineering, social, biological, and medical sciences, business, and
pure mathematics itself. This is a principal reason behind the perpetual
need and demand for mathematicians in education, research centers,
government, and industry.
The department offers three major programs leading to the degrees of
bachelor of arts in mathematics, bachelor of science in mathematics
(with a general mathematics and an applied mathematics option), and
bachelor of science in statistics. It also offers several minor programs for
undergraduates.
At the graduate level, it offers programs leading to the degrees of master
of science in mathematics, master of science in applied mathematics,
master of science in statistics, doctor of philosophy in mathematics, and
doctor of philosophy in applied mathematics.
The Division of Applied Mathematics and Statistics is a part of the
Department of Mathematics.
CALCULUS SEQUENCES

Many degree programs throughout the university include a mathematics
requirement consisting of a sequence in calculus. The Department of
Mathematics offers three calculus sequences:
MATH 021
& MATH 022
& MATH 023
MATH 031
& MATH 032
& MATH 033
MATH 051
& MATH 052

Calculus I
and Calculus II
and Calculus III
Honors Calculus I
and Honors Calculus II
and Honors Calculus III
Survey of Calculus I
and Survey of Calculus II

7

The MATH 021, MATH 022, MATH 023 sequence is a systematic
development of calculus. Most students of mathematics, science,
engineering, and business will take some or all of this sequence.
As an honors sequence, the MATH 031, MATH 032, MATH 033
sequence covers essentially the same material but in greater depth
and with more attention to rigor and proof. This sequence should be
considered by students who have demonstrated exceptional ability in
mathematics. Students who are contemplating a major in mathematics
are strongly encouraged to consider this sequence.
The MATH 051, MATH 052 sequence is a survey of calculus. MATH 081
is a survey course with business applications. This sequence is not
sufficient preparation for most subsequent mathematics courses.
Students contemplating further study in mathematics should consider
MATH 021, MATH 022 instead.
MATH 075, MATH 076 is a two-semester sequence that substitutes for
MATH 021, covering the same material but at a slower pace.
The MATH 031, MATH 032, MATH 033 sequence will be accepted
in place of the other two sequences. MATH 021, MATH 022 will be
accepted in place of MATH 051, MATH 052. Credit will be awarded for
only one course in each of the following groups:
Group 1
MATH 021
MATH 075/076

UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS

The Department of Mathematics offers degree programs in Mathematics
and Statistics. These programs have the flexibility and versatility needed
to prepare students for a wide variety of careers in government, industry,
research and education.
Students in the degree programs in mathematics must satisfy three
types of requirements beyond those required by the college: Core
Mathematics Requirements, Major Requirements and General Electives.
The Core Mathematics Requirement ensures a common core of
knowledge appropriate for students in each program. The Major
Program Electives consist of courses with specific mathematical or
statistical content chosen by the student in consultation with the major
advisor to complement the student's interest and career aspirations.
With these further breadth and greater depth of knowledge are achieved.
The General Electives consist of additional courses chosen from among
those offered by the university faculty. Students can use these electives
to pursue interests beyond the major, or may use these to expand upon
the basic requirements of the degree program. Students are strongly
encouraged to use some of these electives to earn a minor in another
discipline.
Students in the degree program in statistics must satisfy four types of
requirements beyond those required by the college: Required Major
Courses, Major Electives, Professional Electives and Free Electives.
Each student is provided a faculty advisor to guide an individual program
and supervise the selection of electives.
B.A. WITH A MAJOR IN MATHEMATICS

The B.A. program in mathematics emphasizes fundamental principles
as well as the mastery of techniques required for the effective use of
mathematics. The program provides a solid foundation for those who
want to pursue a mathematically oriented career or advanced study in
any mathematically oriented field.

Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics
OUR MISSION

The mission of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and
Mechanics is to provide quality education and training to undergraduate
and graduate students, to develop new knowledge and engineering
methodology through research, and to provide service to industry and
society at large.
STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND GRADUATION DATA

The Mechanical Engineering undergraduate program is accredited
by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (http://
www.abet.org) and is the largest undergraduate program within
Lehigh's P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. Our
enrollment and graduation figures can be found in this table. (http://
www.lehigh.edu/engineering/academics/accredited/#mechanical)
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

In harmony with the mission stated above, the department has adopted
three Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) for the undergraduate
program in Mechanical Engineering.
Program graduates are expected, three to five years from graduation, to:
1. Successfully practice mechanical engineering and/or pursue
advanced education, possibly towards other professions such as law,
medicine, business, etc.
2. Participate at varying degrees in research and development, and
other creative efforts in science, engineering, technology and/or
technological entrepreneurship.
3. Engage in activities that demonstrate a commitment to
professionalism and personal development and possibly demonstrate
leadership qualities.
In order to achieve these objectives the ME program ensures that its
graduates are capable of the eleven Student Outcomes (a-k) proposed
by the accreditation organization ABET and adopted verbatim by the
Lehigh University ME program. These outcomes are:
a. Ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering.

323

b. Ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and
interpret data.
c. An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired
needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental,
social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and
sustainability.
d. Ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams.
e. Ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.
f. Understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
g. Ability to communicate effectively.
h. Broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering
solution in a global and societal context.
i. Recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in lifelong
learning.
j. Knowledge of contemporary issues.
k. Ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools
necessary for engineering practice.
Achievement of the aforementioned educational objectives is served first
through a sound education in mathematics, physics, and engineering
sciences; second, by exposure to the engineering process (creation,
innovation, analysis, and judgment) through design courses, projects,
laboratories, and a choice of technical electives that permits a degree
of specialization; and third, by the development of cultural awareness
through courses in humanities and social sciences. Students may also
take elective courses that transcend traditional disciplinary lines, while
still satisfying the requirements for mechanical engineering.
The undergraduate program provides students with the basic education
they will need to function in an engineering environment, pursue
graduate studies, continue their professional development, and establish
an awareness of the culture and society in which we live. Because
of technological innovations and the long term demands of global
competition, the department seeks to prepare our students to adapt to
the rapid advances and changes in technology, and to serve as agents
and leaders in effecting these changes, while being cognizant of the
needs and concerns of the society at large.
The graduate program bridges between the generalized
undergraduate studies and the more focused research and remarkable
accomplishments of our faculty. New graduate students participate in
research by working closely with their faculty advisors; however, they
are quickly encouraged to work and think independently, assuming
greater responsibility for critical research functions. This learning
process prepares the students for future research and development
positions in industry or academia, where they can contribute toward the
improvement and advancement of the community and society at large.

UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM IN ENGINEERING MECHANICS

3-4

17-18

The curriculum in engineering mechanics is designed to prepare
students for careers in engineering research and development, and
it is especially appropriate for students wishing to specialize in the
analysis of engineering systems. In many industries and governmental
laboratories there is a demand for men and women with broad training
in the fundamentals of engineering in which engineering mechanics and
applied mathematics play an important role.
The first two years of the curriculum is the same as that in mechanical
engineering. One of the advantages of the curriculum is the flexibility it
offers through 18 credits of technical and six credits of personal electives
in the junior and senior years. Beyond the sophomore year there are
required courses in dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, principles of electrical engineering, mathematics, vibrations,
and senior laboratories or projects. It is recommended that the electives
be chosen either to concentrate in areas such as applied mathematics
and computational mechanics, solid mechanics, engineering materials,
and fluid mechanics or to obtain further depth in all areas. The academic
advisor for the engineering mechanics program will provide guidance in
formulating the student's goals and choosing electives.

Army ROTC program provides a means for students to qualify for a
commission as an officer in the Active Army, Army Reserve, or Army
National Guard.
OVERVIEW

The objectives of the military science program are to develop
leadership and management ability in each student; to provide a
basic understanding of the Army’s history, philosophy, organization,
responsibilities, and role in American society; and to develop
fundamental professional knowledge and skills associated with
officership. These objectives are achieved through classroom
instruction, leadership laboratories, realistic training scenarios, exposure
to Army doctrine, professional development, leadership simulations, and
individual assessment and counseling. Army ROTC offers a four-year
program and a two-year program. The four-year program consists of a
two-year basic course and a two-year advanced course. The two-year
program consists of the two-year advanced course offered to students
with previous military experience, and those who have successfully
completed the four-week ROTC Cadet Initial Entry Training. Basic
course students incur no obligation for service in the Army as a result of
taking these courses.
Basic Course

The basic course, normally taken in the freshman and sophomore
years, provides training and instruction in leadership, public speaking,
and basic military subjects, such as the Army’s role and organizational
structure, history and philosophy of the Army, basic tactics, land
navigation, first aid, group dynamics, and leadership traits and
characteristics. Basic course students incur no military obligation and is
only available to freshman and sophomore students.
Advanced Course

The advanced course is normally taken in the junior and senior
years. The instruction includes management, military skills, advanced
leadership and tactics, logistics, administration, military law, ethics,
and professionalism, and includes attendance at the ROTC Cadet
Leadership Course (CLC). Students receive $450 per month
subsistence pay during the junior year and $500 per month in their
senior year.
To enroll in the advanced course, an applicant must complete either
the basic course or the four-week Cadet Initial Entry Training (CIET); or
have received basic course credit for previous military experience.
Note: The Advanced course (300 and 400 level) is a requirement
for Scholarship and contracted cadets only and is not offered to
participating students.
Uniforms and Equipment

Uniforms are provided to contracted and scholarship cadets only. In the
event of lost equipment or uniforms, students will be charged for those
items not returned upon leaving the program.

335

Applied Science, six credits of advanced ROTC work are permissible
within the normal program of each student, irrespective of curriculum.
For curricula that include more than six hours of personal electives in the
junior and senior years, inclusion of the more than six hours of ROTC
credit with normal programs can be effected only with the approval of
academic advisers. All military science credits, including those in the
basic course, apply toward the student’s overall cumulative grade point
average.
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

Individuals are commissioned as officers in the United States
Army after completion of the ROTC program including the Cadet
Leadership Course (CLC), and the completion of their bachelors
degree requirements. They then qualify in one of seventeen branches
(specialties) such as the Corps of Engineers, Infantry, Armor, Aviation,
Field Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Signal Corps, Cyber Corps, Military
Intelligence, Chemical Corps, Ordnance Corps, Finance, Transportation,
Military Police, Adjutant General, Quartermaster, Medical Service
Corps, or Nursing. Officers work as leaders/managers, specialists, or
combinations of the two depending on the assignment.
PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES
ROTC Scholarship Program

This program is designed to offer financial assistance to outstanding
young men and women entering the ROTC program who are interested
in an Army career. Scholarships provide full annual tuition, a textbook
allowance, and common fees; in addition to pay up to $500 per month
for the period the scholarship is in effect. Three-year and two-year
scholarships may be available to outstanding cadets who are currently
enrolled in the ROTC program and are completing their freshman or
sophomore year of college. This program is also open to all qualified
students who are not currently enrolled in Army ROTC.
Four-year scholarships are open to all students entering ROTC as
freshmen. Applications for scholarship must be made to Headquarters,
U.S. Army Cadet Command, Fort Knox, KY by July 15th prior to the
high school senior year for early selection, but no later than November

Two-Year Program

Students who want to enroll in ROTC after their sophomore year may
apply. Applicants must successfully complete a four-week Cadet Initial
Entry Training (CIET) and have two years of undergraduate or graduate
studies remaining. The student is paid for the four-week encampment
and receives transportation costs to and from the camp. Additional
scholarships may be available at this camp.
Physical Facilities

Qualified students transferring from another institution may enter the
ROTC program at the appropriate level and year, provided they have
received the necessary credits, the recommendation of their former
professor of military science (if applicable), and the approval of Cadet
Command and the university. Please contact the ROTC office for details.

Army ROTC uses areas on and adjacent to the university campus to
conduct field training. These locations are excellent for most outdoor
activities such as orienteering, patrolling, and survival training. Fort
Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, located east of Harrisburg, Pa.,
and Fort Dix, NJ, located east of Philadelphia, Pa., are used for various
weekend field exercises which allow cadets to apply the classroom
leadership and Army doctrine in a training environment.

Obligation after Graduation

Off-campus U.S. Army Training Schools

Upon graduation, a student will receive a commission as a Second
Lieutenant in either the Active Army, Army Reserves, or National Guard.
If offered active duty, scholarship students serve four years of active
duty and four years of inactive ready reserve. If offered reserve duty,
students normally serve eight years in a Reserve or National Guard unit.

Cadets may be selected to attend the following U.S. Army Schools:
Airborne School (Fort Benning, Georgia), Air Assault School (Fort
Campbell, Kentucky), Mountain Warfare School (Ethan Allen Training
Center, Vermont), and Northern Warfare School (Fort Greely, Alaska)

Transfers

Graduate Studies

ROTC graduates may request to delay their active service to pursue
a full-time course of instruction leading to an advanced degree. The
only four major areas of concentration are medical school, law school,
veterinary school and seminary. Delay does not lengthen the active
service obligation unless the degree is obtained at government expense.
Course Credit

Modern Languages and Literatures
Knowledge of other languages opens the door to other cultures,
traditions, and perspectives on the world, and promotes deeper insight
into one’s own language and culture. Proficiency in modern languages
is indispensable in a broad range of professions such as journalism,
government, international affairs, law, the armed forces, and business.
A bachelor of arts degree with a major in languages provides excellent
preparation for professional careers in law, business, and the media.
Language study is required for graduate study in many disciplines, as
well as for research in science and technology. International experience
is personally enriching and enhances career prospects.
Languages offered
Lehigh offers Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Hebrew,
Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Courses include oral, reading, and
writing skills, literature, film, culture, civilization, and professional areas
such as business and health careers. A number of literature and culture
courses are given in English, but most offerings stress classroom use of
the target language.
Language requirements
The Global Studies major, the Joint IR/MLL major, as well as the honors
major in international relations require language study. The college
scholar program in the College of Arts and Sciences, the major in Asian
Studies, the minors in Latin American Studies, and Asian Studies require
language study. Students taking the B.A. in international relations are
expected to study a language. Some doctoral programs also require
competence in a language other than English, usually assessed by the
Department of Modern Languages and Literatures.
Advising
Because of the sequential nature of language study and the variety
of specializations available, the department pays special attention to
student advising. Students whose experience, skills, and placement
scores (Advanced Placement or College Board Achievement Test) do
not give them a clear indication of their level of placement should consult
with their instructor or the department chair.

advanced standing.
Elementary I (4) Intermediate I (4)
Elementary II (4) Intermediate II (4)
Advanced courses
Except where otherwise noted, 200 or 300-level courses are open to
students having completed eight credit hours beyond Intermediate II.
Exceptions require the consent of the instructor.
Language of instruction
All courses are taught in the target language except MLL courses
listed under “International Cultures and Literatures Taught in English.”
Students thereby become accustomed to considering the language as
an active means of communication and not solely as an object of study.
Language placement
Students are normally placed in language courses on the basis of
years of a language taken in high school, CEEB Achievement Test
score, or the departmental equivalent (instructor’s test, interview, or
questionnaire). Students may change levels within a language during the
first two weeks of class. Students who consider themselves capable of
higher-level performance may apply to the instructor during the first two
weeks of the semester for more advanced placement. They may also
be allowed by the department chair to be admitted for credit to a lowerlevel language course after consultation with the instructor. Students
who have had three years or more of a language in high school and
drop to first-semester level will not receive credit for the course.
No course under 100 level may be taken for credit once a higher
course has been passed.

These courses are offered by Lehigh or under the Cooperation
agreement with the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges.
Summer or semester study abroad at approved programs may be
incorporated into language majors and minors with the permission of the
appropriate advisor to a maximum of 16 credits toward the major and
eight credits toward the minor.
INTERNATIONAL CULTURES AND LITERATURES TAUGHT IN ENGLISH

These courses on international cultures and comparative topics carry no
prerequisites; knowledge of the language is not required.
Language majors may count one MLL course taught in English for credit
toward a major requirement. Interested students should consult their
language major advisors. For course descriptions, see under each
language area below.
HEBREW

The department offers courses both separately and in the context of the
Jewish studies minor (p. 287).

and social subjects listed under “International Culture and Literature
Taught in English."

Modern Hebrew is taught in the Department of Modern Languages
and Literature. Biblical Hebrew is taught in the Department of Religion
Studies.

These courses may, in most cases, be taken to fulfill preliminary
distribution requirements. One of these courses may be included in the
major.

the list of electives below, in consultation with the minor advisor. (One

Music

Music
The study of music develops skills which will serve the student well in
any career: self-discipline, teamwork, problem solving and leadership.
A student graduating with the B.A. degree in music will have a strong
foundation in music theory and substantial exposure to western music
from the Middle Ages to the present. This curriculum will prepare a
student for graduate studies in musicology, music theory, composition,
jazz, conducting, or performance. A music major or minor taken in
conjunction with a business major may lead to a variety of careers in arts
management or in the recording and music publishing industries. For
some a double major or a minor in music will not lead to a career but to
a lifelong involvement with an art form that gives lasting satisfaction.
The music department (http://music.cas2.lehigh.edu) also offers
significant performance experiences in instrumental and vocal
ensembles, large and small, and in private instruction. The Zoellner
Arts Center (http://zoellner.cas2.lehigh.edu) facilities include a Listening
Library, practice rooms, a composition and digital class piano studio,
a fine recording studio, classrooms and rehearsal rooms. Most
importantly, the center boasts its concert facility, Baker Hall. With its
1000-seat capacity and excellent acoustics, it is flexible both on the
stage (concert or theater mode) and in seating arrangements. The fully
adjustable pit can serve opera or musical theatre, can provide additional
seating, or can become an extension of the stage.
Professors. Paul F. Salerni, PhD (Harvard University); Steven P.
Sametz, DMUS (University of Wisconsin); Nadine J. Sine, PhD (New
York University)

The student must perform a half recital in the junior year, a full recital
in the senior year, and juries during the sophomore and junior years.

MAJOR PROGRAM

The Bachelor of Arts in Music (36-credit minimum) is for those students
who wish to have double majors, who might choose a related field (e.g.,
arts management, part-time performance careers in orchestras) or
who simply want a concentrated exposure to music study. Students
choose between five different concentrations: performance; history
and literature; theory and composition; jazz; conducting. For those who
intend to pursue graduate study in music or a performing career, the
major program should be viewed as the minimum requirement. Such
students should regularly seek the advice of department faculty in
expanding their program to suit their particular needs and goals.

Originally encompassing all fields of study, philosophy remains the
foundational discipline of all the disciplines at the university and the
core of a liberal arts education. At once both highly theoretical and
profoundly practical, philosophical thinking is reflective and critical
conceptual activity concerned with some of the most enduring and
challenging of fundamental questions about the nature, meaning, and
possibilities of human existence, the world, and the ways we think
about them. What makes humans human? What is the best way to
live? What can we know? What really exists? How can we think well?
What are goodness, truth, beauty, space, time, causation, language,
consciousness, happiness, freedom, rationality, justice? Questions like
these occur to most people, especially when we are young; cherished
beliefs and assumptions about them structure our lives, often without
our being aware of them. Philosophers are gripped by such questions
and seek to address them through creatively critical thinking, reasoned
analysis and argumentation, and thoughtful discussion, instead of
making assumptions or accepting answers to them based on opinion
or prejudice. The study of philosophy develops skills in careful and
flexible thinking, critical analysis, sound reasoning and argumentation,
objective evaluation, clear and persuasive writing, and the toleration of
uncertainty.

THE MAJOR PROGRAM

The major program in philosophy is designed to provide a broad
exposure to the major areas of philosophy as well as a strong grounding
in the history of the western philosophical tradition. The program
emphasizes the close reading and critical evaluation of classic texts
from ancient times to the present, and students can expect to develop
sophisticated analytic and expository skills that will enable them to
engage in original, critical reflection on their own. The major program
provides excellent preparation for graduate study in philosophy as well
as a solid foundation for any career that places a premium upon clear,
careful thinking, rigorous conceptual and analytical skills, and effective
written and oral communication.

Writing-Intensive Requirement

Majors are strongly encouraged to fulfill their junior writing-intensive
requirement by taking a WI-designated philosophy course.
SENIOR THESIS

The senior thesis is a year-long independent project during which
philosophy majors, with the consent and under the guidance of a
philosophy faculty advisor, investigate a topic of special interest to them.
The topic may be historical or non-historical, pure or applied, disciplinary
or interdisciplinary; the only constraint is that the topic must be approved
by the thesis advisor. Seniors take PHIL 390 in the fall, devoting their
energies to refining the topic, working through the bulk of the essential
literature, and producing a paper roughly 20 pages in length on the
thesis topic. PHIL 391 is taken in the spring semester of the senior year
and is focused on investigating the topic more intensively, expanding,

Courses

PHIL 002 Intro: Philosophical Questions 4 Credits
One way of understanding philosophy is not as a set of teachings to
be mastered but as the rational attempt to formulate, understand, and
answer fundamental questions. This course explores some of the most
basic questions, including: What is the meaning of life? What is it to be
a human person, to be a self? Is human nature fundamentally good or
evil? How should we live our lives? What is happiness? What makes
a society just? Is knowledge possible? What is really real? Is there a
God? Is there such a thing as free will or has the course of our lives
been determined by fate, God, or biology?
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 003 (REL 003) Global Religion, Global Ethics 4 Credits
Introduction to philosophical and religious modes of moral thinking, with
attention given to ethical issues as they arise cross-culturally in and

health, the death penalty, religiously motivated violence, and problems
of personal disorder (heavy drinking, anorexia, vengeance).
Attribute/Distribution: HU

PHIL 004 Intro: Belief, Knowledge, and Action 4 Credits
Through reading selected texts in philosophy, from the ancient period
to the modern Enlightenment and Romantic reaction, we shall introduce
ourselves to some of the central epistemological, ontological, ethical,
and socio-political positions developed in relation to their historical and
material contexts. A unifying theme thus will be the emergence and
evolution of rational thought and its relation to belief, knowledge, and
action.
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 005 Intro: Contemporary Moral Problems 4 Credits
An examination of contemporary issues that raise questions about right
and wrong, good and bad, both for individuals and for social policy,
using the methods, theories, and concepts of moral philosophy.
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 006 Intro: Conduct and Character 4 Credits
How should we live our lives? How should we act? What kinds of
persons should we be? What should we care about? These are among
the central questions of philosophy because they are among the most
central questions of human existence. This explores answers that have
been proposed by thinkers throughout history and across cultures.
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 007 Intro: Emerson, Thoreau, and Beyond 4 Credits
Emerson and Thoreau write to revive our dumb words and numb lives.
Emerson tells us that what matters is not having lived, but living, not
having read somebody's book, but thinking. And somehow all this
wonderful excitement comes from creation, from becoming, and all
becoming is becoming new. There is no unhappy creation. The literary
power of Emerson and Thoreau, of Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller

PHIL 015 Intro: Friendship 4 Credits
Because of the importance of friendship to be happy and fulfilled
human life, philosophers, from ancient times to the present have
devoted considerable attention to it. In this , we shall read and discuss
a variety of philosophical conceptions of friendship and its value.
Among the philosophical classics to be considered are works by Plato,
Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Aquinas, Montaigne, Kant, Thoreau, and
Kierkegaard. We shall also consider several contemporary treatments of
the subject.

such as Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Kant, Mill and Nietzsche.
Attribute/Distribution: HU

PHIL 016 Intro: Free Will and Responsibility 4 Credits
Do we choose who we become as we mature, or is who we become
foreordained? Are we born with a unique self, or is the self produced
by our interaction with external forces? Are we free agents who can be
held responsible for our actions, or is free will an illusion? This course
explores these questions and the implications of answers for moral,
political, and social values.
Attribute/Distribution: HU

Moral issues that arise in the context of health care and related
biomedical fields in the United States today, examined in the light of the

Attribute/Distribution: HU

PHIL 020 Intro: The Examined Life in Film and Literature 4 Credits
Socrates claimed the "the unexamined life is not worth living" and
Western philosophers have for 2400 years taken that challenge to
heart. But there are other ways of examining the human condition
philosophically than in the writings of philosophers. This course uses
works of literature (novels, plays, and poems) and film that address the
same issues that Western philosophers have addressed, and continue
to address: the natures of truth, justice, the good, reality, the self,
happiness, the meaningfulness of life.
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 023 Intro: Artists on Art and Life 4 Credits
One of the peculiarities of the philosophical study or art, Aesthetics, is
that philosophers ignore the writings of artists on art. This introduction
to philosophy does not. Aestheticians spend much of their time writing
about what art is. Artists are more interested in what art does and how
art does it, and those questions will be the focus of this . We will be
reading the words of and looking at the artwork of artists who might
include: van Gogh, Cezanne, Madeline Gins, Picasso, Alberti, Hogarth,
Mondrain, Kandinsky, Klee, Debussy, Leonardo, Le Corbusier, Anne
Truit, Schoenberg, Tarkovsky, Boccioni, Alison Knowles, Alan Kaprow,
Laurie Anderson, Robert Venturi and Denis Scott Brown, Francis Bacon,
and more.
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 024 Intro: Good, God, and Evil 4 Credits
The problem traditionally known as "theodicy" asks how God (theos) is
related to justice (dike). If the world isn't perfectly good, very good, or
even pretty good, how can it be that God is both good and powerful, allgood (omnibenevolent) and all-powerful (omnipotent)? We can solve the
problem of God and evil by saying that God is not all that good or not all
that powerful-and indeed theologians and others have gone that route.
But what if we don't want to relinquish God's goodness or His power?
What then can we say? What have the great philosophers and religious
thinkers said?
Attribute/Distribution: HU
PHIL 027 Intro: Beyond The Edge of Darkness 4 Credits
One of the on-going concerns of philosophical reflection, both East and
West, has been to provide an account of the existential landscape within
which we find ourselves that offers an alternative to the circumstantial
frustrations and tragedies with which our experience seems to confront
us. We will examine texts from a variety of trajectories, and traditions,
some of which seem designed to highlight our predicament, some of
which seem designed to resolve it.

PHIL 128 Philosophy Of Science 4 Credits
Science obviously works, and newer theories surely are better than the

and in what sense is it progressive? Is science a revelation of reality,

still open, questions.

PHIL 241 (REL 241) Critics Of Religion 4 Credits
In recent years, with the resurgence of religion as a significant political
force globally, the claims of religion have been subjected to renewed
scrutiny and critique. A wide array of scientists, philosophers, and
social critics (e.g., Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, Sam Harris,
Christopher Hitchens) have challenged religion’s basic claims and
provide alternative rational, scientifically grounded explanations.
However, in many instances, these books fall short of the powerful
critiques, previously formulated by philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza
and Friedrich Nietzsche, or those of contemporary French philosophers
Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. In this seminar, we shall explore
in-depth the critiques of religion contained in the writings of Spinoza,
Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Foucault and Deleuze. Students will have an
opportunity to examine one or more of the recent critiques of religion in
light of the arguments of these philosophers.

Photonics
PHOTONICS

The Master of Science Degree in Photonics is an interdisciplinary
program designed to provide students with a broad training in the
various aspects of photonics, including topics in electrical engineering,
materials science, and physics. Admission to the program requires a
B.S. or M.S. in either the engineering or physical sciences.
Applications should be directed to one of the three sponsoring
departments (Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science
and Engineering, or Physics). Procedures and admission criteria are the
same as those followed by the home department. International students
must satisfy minimum university language requirements. The admissions
process is under the supervision of the individual department to which
you apply.

Physics
Physics students study the basic laws of mechanics, heat and
thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, optics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and elementary particles. Students also study applications
of the basic theories to the description of bulk matter, including the
mechanical, electric, magnetic, and thermal properties of solids, liquids,
gases, and plasmas, and to the description of the structure of atoms
and nuclei. In addition, students develop the laboratory skills and
techniques of the experimental physicist, skills that can be applied in
the experimental search for new knowledge or in applications relating to
known theories.
A majority of physics graduates go to graduate school in physics,
often earning the Ph.D. degree. These graduates take university
or college faculty positions, or work on research in a variety of
university, government, or industrial laboratories. Some students
choose employment immediately after the bachelor’s degree. They use
their many approved and free electives to supplement their science
background with applied courses, such as engineering, to develop the
skills needed for a position in a particular area.
Because of the fundamental role of physics in all natural sciences,
students also use the physics major as an excellent preparation
for graduate study in many other scientific areas, such as optical
engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, biophysics,
molecular biology, astrophysics, geology and geophysics, materials
science and engineering, meteorology, or physical oceanography.
Attractive engineering areas with a high science content include optical
communications, aeronautical engineering, nuclear engineering,
including both fission and fusion devices; electrical engineering,
including instrumentation; electronics and solid-state devices, electrical
discharges and other plasma-related areas; and mechanical engineering
and mechanics, including fluids and continuum mechanics. The broad
scientific background developed in the physics curriculum is also an

359

excellent background for professional schools, such as law (particularly
patent law), medicine, and optometry.
Lehigh offers three undergraduate degrees in physics and two
undergraduate degrees in astronomy or astrophysics. The three
physics degrees are the bachelor of arts with a major in physics and the
bachelor of science in physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, and
the bachelor of engineering physics in the College of Engineering and
Applied Science. The B.A. with a major in astronomy and the B.S. in
astrophysics are in the College of Arts and Sciences and are described
in the Astronomy and Astrophysics section of this catalog.
In addition, there are several five-year, dual-degree programs involving
physics: The Arts-Engineering program (see the Arts-Engineering
section of this catalog), the combination of the bachelor of science
program in the College of Arts and Sciences with electrical engineering
(described below), and the combination of electrical engineering and
engineering physics (see the Electrical Engineering and Engineering
Physics section of this catalog).
The bachelor of science curriculum in the College of Arts and Sciences
requires somewhat more physics and mathematics than the bachelor
of arts major, while the latter provides more free electives and fewer
hours for graduation. By making good use of the electives in these
programs, students can pursue graduate work in physics or physical
aspects of other science or engineering disciplines, or technical careers
requiring a basic knowledge of physics. The bachelor of arts curriculum
is particularly useful for those planning careers in areas where some
knowledge of physics is needed or useful, but is not the main subject,
such as science writing, secondary school teaching, patent law, or
medicine. The bachelor of science in engineering physics curriculum in
the College of Engineering and Applied Science requires an engineering
concentration in either solid state electronics or optical sciences, in
addition to regular physics and mathematics courses. This four-year
program prepares students to do engineering work in an overlap area
between physics and engineering. This may involve engineering in a
forefront area in which it is desirable to have more physics knowledge
than that typically provided in an engineering program. It may be a
field of experimental physics which either relies heavily on forefront
engineering or in which the nature of the problem dictates that scientists
and engineers will accomplish more working together rather than
separately.
Requirements and recommended course sequences are described
below for programs in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the P. C.
Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. Note that no more
than 6 credits of military science may be applied toward any degree
program.

A majority of physics, astronomy, and engineering physics majors take
advantage of opportunities to participate in research under the direction
of a faculty member. Research areas available to undergraduates are
the same as those available to graduate students; they are described
below under the heading For Graduate Students. Undergraduate
student research is arranged informally as early as the sophomore (or,
occasionally, freshman) year at the initiation of the student or formally
as a senior research project. In addition, a number of students receive
financial support to do research during the summer between their junior
and senior years, either as Physics Department Summer Research
Participants or as Sherman Fairchild Scholars.

The use of electives

The electives available in each of the physics and astronomy curricula
provide the student with an opportunity to develop special interests
and to prepare for graduate work in various allied areas. In particular,
the many available upper-level physics, mathematics, and engineering
courses can be used by students in consultation with their faculty
advisors to structure programs with special emphases in a variety
of areas such as optical communications, solid-state electronics, or
biophysics.

Five-Year programs that lead to successive bachelor and master’s
degrees are available. These programs satisfy all of the requirements of
one of the five bachelor’s degrees in physics (B.A., B.S., B.S.E.P.) and
astronomy/astrophysics (B.A., B.S.), plus the requirements of the M.S.
in physics in the final year. Depending upon the undergraduate degree
received, one summer in residence may be required. Interested students
should contact the associate chair of physics no later than the spring
semester of their junior year for further detail.
THE MINOR PROGRAM

The minor in physics consists of 15 credits of physics courses, excluding
PHY 005 and ASTR 007. No more than one physics course required
in a student’s major program may be included in the minor program.
The minor program must be designed in consultation with the physics
department chair.
FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS

The department of physics has concentrated its research activities within
several fields of physics, with the result that a number of projects are
available in each area. Current departmental research activities include
the following:
Condensed matter physics. Areas of interest include the optical
and electronic properties of defects in semiconductors and insulators,
quantum phenomena in semiconductor devices, collective dynamics
of disordered solids, structural phase transitions in ferroelectrics and
superconducting crystals, theory of quantum charge transport in
nanotubes and single molecule systems, physics of nano devices.
Atomic and molecular physics. Research topics include atomic
and molecular spectroscopy and collision processes. Recent work
has addressed velocity-changing collisions, diffusion, energy-pooling
collisions, charge exchange, fine structure mixing, light-induced drift and
radiation trapping.
Cosmology and string theory: This research area examines the
fundamental structure of spacetime and the quantum nature of gravity.
Research directions include a wide range of topics in quantum field
theory and string theory, with applications to strongly coupled gauge
theories, gravity and theoretical cosmology.
High-energy physics: The department provides both theoretical and
experimental research opportunities in the field of high-energy physics.
Experimental work involves the examination of the quark gluon plasma
(QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions by using particle jets and heavy
flavor quarks as probes of the medium. These studies make use of
the Solenoidal Tracker (STAR) detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC), and other accelerator experiments. Theoretical studies
address fundamental aspects and phenomenological applications of

363

string theory, gravitational descriptions of quantum field theory, and
gauge/string dualities.
Nonlinear optics and photonics. Research topics include nonlinear
light-matter interaction that enable the control of light with light,
four-wave mixing, phase conjugation, resonant Brillouin scattering,
ferroelectric domain patterning for quasi phase matching, waveguides,
photonic crystals, holey and other specialty fibers, and the application of
photonics to biological systems.
Plasma physics. Computational studies of magnetically confined
toroidal plasmas address anomalous thermal and particle transport,
large scale instabilities, and radiofrequency heating. Laboratory studies
address collisional and collisionless phenomena of supercritical laserproduced plasmas.
Statistical physics. Investigation is underway of nonequilibrium
fluctuations in gases, chaotic transitions and 1/f dynamics, lightscattering spectroscopy, colloidal suspensions, the nonlinear dynamics
of granular particles, and pattern formation in nonequilibrium dissipative
systems, including the kinetics of phase transitions and spatiotemporal
chaos.
Soft condensed matter and biological physics. Current research
topics include both the experimental and theoretical studies of complex
fluids including biological polymers, colloids, and biological cells and
tissues. Laser tweezers, Raman scattering, photoluminescence and
advanced 3-D optical imaging techniques are integrated for investigating
the structures and dynamical properties of these systems. Theoretical
studies focus on the kinetics of phase transitions, including the
crystallization of globular and membrane proteins and also the modeling
of interactions of proteins and nanotubes.
Complex fluids. Polymers in aqueous solutions, colloidal suspensions,
and surfactant solutions are investigated using techniques such as “laser
tweezers,” video-enhanced microscopy, and laser light scattering. Areas
of interest include the structures of polymers at liquid-solid interfaces
and microrheology of confined macromolecules. Recent work addresses
systems of biological significance.
Computational physics. Several of the above areas involve the use
of state-of-the-art computers to address large-scale computational
problems. Areas of interest include atom-atom collisions, simulations
of tokamak plasmas, the statistical behavior of ensembles of many
particles, the calculation of electronic wave functions for molecules and
solids, and the multi-scale modeling of nano-bio systems.
Candidates for advanced degrees normally will have completed, before
beginning their graduate studies, the requirements for a bachelor’s
degree with a major in physics, including advanced mathematics beyond
differential and integral calculus. Students lacking the equivalent of this
preparation will make up deficiencies in addition to taking the specified
work for the degree sought.
At least eight semester hours of general college physics using calculus
are required for admission to all 200- and 300-level courses. Additional
prerequisites for individual courses are noted in the course descriptions.
Admission to 400-level courses generally is predicated on satisfactory
completion of corresponding courses in the 200- and 300-level groups or
their equivalent.

The major in political science is designed to promote understanding
of political ideas, institutions and processes and to develop skills in
analyzing and evaluating political problems.
A balanced program within the discipline, one that exposes the student
to various areas of inquiry in political institutions and political processes
as well as in the comparative and philosophical perspectives of political
analysis, has been the way in which the goals of the major program
generally have been achieved. While the major program outlined below
will prove adequate for most student needs, it may be that some special
factors such as late transfer or unusual interests and/or abilities the
outlined program does not accommodate some students. In that case
the students may, in consultation with their advisers, develop a major
program that in their judgment will more adequately fulfill those needs.
The faculty adviser to the student majoring in political science is
designated by the department. The adviser consults with the student and
approves the major program. The adviser attempts to help the student
relate courses offered by the department to the student’s educational
goals. The adviser also may act as a resource for the student, and may
suggest courses in other disciplines, language courses, and courses in
research techniques that may be of benefit.
A variety of experiential opportunities are available to undergraduates
majoring in political science. The department, for example, offers a
Community Politics Internship every semester that includes opportunities
for internship placements in either local government, private agencies

Polymer Science and Engineering
Lehigh has a diverse group of faculty members with strong, primary
interest in polymer science and engineering. In order to provide better
opportunities for courses and research in this interdisciplinary field,
activities are coordinated through the Center for Polymer Science and
Engineering (CPSE), and its academic Polymer Education Committee.
Polymer faculty from traditional departments of chemical engineering,

375

chemistry, materials science and engineering, physics, and mechanical
engineering and mechanics, are participants of the CPSE.
There are two ways in which qualified graduate students, with degrees
in the above or related fields, may participate. Students may pursue
graduate studies within an appropriate department. Departmental
procedures must be followed for the degree sought. The student’s
adviser must be in that department and the student receives a normal
departmental degree, with emphasis in polymer courses and research.
Such students are encouraged to pursue a graduate certificate in
polymer science and engineering.
Alternatively, students may elect to pursue studies toward an
interdisciplinary M.S., M.E., or Ph.D. degree in polymer science and
engineering. The procedures for this latter case are summarized as
follows.
Students are admitted through one of the participating departments and
must meet that department's admissions criteria. When the student is
ready (must have taken/be taking at least one polymer course and be in
good standing in the department), the student petitions to transfer to the
Polymer Science and Engineering graduate program. After the petition
is approved, his/her degree program becomes Polymer Science and
Engineering, but the student remains in the home department.
Master of Science Degree in Polymer Science and Engineering

Master of Science Degree in Polymer Science and Engineering requires
a total of 24 credits in course work and six credits in research. The
masters thesis is directed and signed by a faculty member of the Center
for Polymer Science and Engineering and co-signed by the chairman of
the Polymer Education Committee or the director of the CPSE.
Master of Engineering Degree in Polymer Science and Engineering

Master of Engineering Degree in Polymer Science and Engineering
requires a total of 30 credits of course work. This option is intended for
those students who do not work in a laboratory setting, or for whom
thesis research is not practical, but who wish to obtain an advanced
education in polymer science and engineering.
Ph.D. in Polymer Science and Engineering

For the Ph.D., the student must satisfactorily complete a qualifying
examination administered by the Polymer Education Committee;
satisfactorily complete graduate course work determined in consultation
with the doctoral committee; pass a general examination administered
by the Polymer Education Committee; and defend to the satisfaction of
the doctoral committee, a dissertation in the field of polymer science and
engineering. Students deficient in polymer science or related topics may
be required by their committee to take remedial course work.
The doctoral committee consists of the research adviser, at least two
other members of the center for polymer science and engineering, and
at least one outside person. The committee’s composition is subject to
approval by the Polymer Education Committee and the Graduate and
Research Committee of the university.
For more information, write to Dr. Raymond A. Pearson, Director, Center
for Polymer Science and Engineering, Whitaker Laboratory, 5 E. Packer
Avenue, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015, or Dr. James E.
Roberts, Seeley G. Mudd Building #6, Chairman, Polymer Education
Committee, Lehigh University, 6 E. Packer Avenue, Bethlehem, PA
18015 or Ms. Lisa Arechiga, Graduate Coordinator Whitaker Laboratory,
5 E. Packer Avenue, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015. Please
address applications to one of the participating departments.

Optional Concentration

Students in the B.A. program may choose to complete an optional
concentration. Concentrations are available in four areas: Cognition and
Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental; Social and Personality; and
Clinical and Behavioral Health. Completion of a concentration involves
selecting specific 100-level breadth courses and 300-level seminars
within the concentration. See listings of individual concentration courses
below.
Recommended Electives

The B.A. program in psychology is a flexible preparation for a number
of fields. With suitable selection of additional courses, students can
prepare themselves for graduate study in any subfield of psychology
or for careers in areas for which psychology is a desirable and relevant
major such as neuroscience, law, social work, marketing, management,
and education.
Depending on the specific subfield of interest, many courses in
other departments within CAS, and in other Colleges, may be
relevant. Examples include Biological Sciences (especially the
Behavioral Neuroscience program), Philosophy, Sociology and
Anthropology, Marketing, Economics, Management, Education, and in
the interdisciplinary programs of Cognitive Science; Women, Gender,
and Sexuality Studies; Health, Medicine, and Society; Global Studies;
and Africana Studies.
For graduate programs in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields,
additional coursework in research and statistics is desirable, as is
engagement in supervised research and participation in the honors
program.
Preparation for programs in health-related areas such as nursing,
medicine, and dentistry will include additional coursework in biology,
chemistry, and physics. Students should consult with the appropriate
pre-professional advisors to determine specific requirements.
Students interested in applying psychology to fields such as law,
marketing, social work, management, or education should consult with
faculty in those areas to discuss relevant courses.
B.S. MAJOR PROGRAM IN PSYCHOLOGY

The Bachelor of Science in psychology is a highly structured and
comprehensive behavioral science major requiring 13 courses
(approximately 49 credit hours) in psychology and 10 collateral courses
(approximately 35-40 credit hours) as described below. Students must
also fulfill college and university degree requirements. Students pursuing
a wide-range of post-graduate plans may find this program fits their
needs and interests. One difference between the B.S. in psychology and
other B.S. programs is that the collateral requirements for the B.S. in
psychology allow for a level of breadth that is not always possible in B.S.
programs. The collateral courses for the B.S. in psychology span three
areas (Mathematics and Computer Science; Natural Science; and Social
and Cognitive Science). Hence, students with wide-ranging interests
may find that they can pursue their varied interests while fulfilling the
collateral requirements for this B.S. program. For students considering
graduate programs in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields,
additional coursework in research and statistics is desirable, as is
engagement in supervised research and participation in the honors
program.
Students in the B.S. program must complete a concentration in
Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental; Social and
Personality; or Clinical and Behavioral Health. Progression through the

Lehigh University 2016-2017

program is best served through early commitment. Students who do
not declare their majors early may find it difficult to complete the B.S.
major program. Transfer credits and study abroad course work may be
applied toward the major; however, students must take a minimum of
two 100-level breadth courses, three 300-level seminars, and PSYC 210
at Lehigh to earn a psychology major from Lehigh.
Requirements for the B.S. in Psychology
Collateral Requirements

For students in the B.S. program, collateral courses can be used to

FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS

The Department of Psychology offers a distinctive, research-intensive
graduate program centered on Human Cognition and Development
with specializations in cognitive, developmental and social psychology.
The department accepts mainly Ph.D. students, who obtain a master’s
degree in the process of working for the doctorate. However, wellqualified students may also be accepted for a Master of Science
degree. Students are trained primarily for positions at universities,
and in basic or applied research settings. For more information visit:
http://psychology.cas2.lehigh.edu/content/welcome-graduate-programpsychology.
In addition we offer two non-degree Certificate Programs in collaboration
with other departments and programs.
The Graduate Certificate in Stereotypes, Prejudice, Discrimination, and
Intergroup Relations is administered by the Psychology Department.

The Science, Technology and Society (STS) program is the product of a
continuing cross-college effort to create a common ground from which to
explore the relations between science, technology and society: between
ideas, machines and values.
The STS program serves as a focal point for a wide range of courses
that study the natures of science and of technology, and analyze their
social and personal implications. It lends coherence and visibility to
offerings otherwise dispersed throughout the catalog.
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY (STS) MAJOR

The major in science, technology and society studies prepares students
for graduate study or for a wide variety of career opportunities including
policy analysis, planning, or community relations with public or private
sector agencies concerned with the social relations of scientific research
and technological innovation. The intrinsically cross-disciplinary
character of science-technology-society interactions is reflected in the
B.A. requirements.
Majors must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in STS courses,
listed below, together with at least 15 credit hours in any traditional
academic discipline: engineering, physical or life science, the
humanities, or the social sciences. This collateral set of courses should
be chosen in consultation with the program director to provide the
foundation needed to engage STS studies issues in which that discipline
is implicated. The senior seminar provides an opportunity for students
to integrate the knowledge they have gained and the skills they have
acquired in their coursework.

School Psychology
The School Psychology Program offers two degree programs: An
Educational Specialist (Ed.S.) degree and a doctoral degree (Ph.D.).
Certification as a school psychologist in the state of Pennsylvania is
associated with both degree programs.
Both degree programs are approved by the National Association of
School Psychologists (NASP), while the Ph.D. program is additionally
accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The
Pennsylvania Department of Education has approved our program’s
certification in school psychology.
Graduates of the Ed.S. program are prepared to serve as school
psychologists in school districts. Graduates of the Ph.D. program have
a broader range of employment options, including practitioner positions
in school district, clinical, and hospital settings, as well as positions as
researchers and professors in academic settings.
Fundamental to the School Psychology program is a commitment to a
scientist-practitioner model. Students in our degree programs complete
coursework and field-based experiences that prepare them to apply
critical skills for delivering evidenced-based practices to children and
youth. Moreover, our programs operate from an ecological perspective.
Students are well prepared to address the contextual influences on
children’s educational achievement and health.
The School Psychology program has developed concentrated training
opportunities, including coursework and practicum, in unique areas.
These opportunities have been initiated through federal funding from
the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE), and are sustained by
faculty expertise. For example, in the Ed.S. program, students may
seek specialized training in Response-to-Intervention, while the Ph.D.
program is distinguished by its offering of two concentrations: Pediatric
School Psychology and School-Based Prevention.
The USDOE-funded Leadership Program in Pediatric School
Psychology is a signature program in the doctoral program. Through
specialized and expanded field-based training and coursework, this
program provides opportunities for students to go beyond the School
Psychology program’s general curriculum for the pediatric school
psychology concentration.

Sociology and Anthropology
Web site: http://socanthro.cas2.lehigh.edu/. The department houses two
disciplines, sociology and anthropology. Sociology is concerned with
the study of human beings in relationships with others. Anthropology
takes a holistic approach to the study of humans today and in the past,
in a global, comparative, and multidimensional perspective. Together
these disciplines encompass the study of the broadest range of human
activities, from the comparative examination of widely divergent past
and present cultures and societies, to the inner life of individuals as this
influences social behavior, to an examination of the most pressing social
issues of our time.
The offerings within the department seek to foster self and societal
awareness as well as an understanding of what it means to be human.
Instruction within the department also provides students with the
necessary analytic skills to understand and conduct social research.
Central to the department's major programs is training in research
methods, statistics, and the use of computer applications in social
science.

395

The department maintains close working relationships with a variety
of social agencies and institutions in the area. Majors can earn course
credit by carrying out supervised work in field settings—see http://
socanthro.cas2.lehigh.edu/ for more details. This experience allows a
student to apply the concepts learned in the classroom to a field setting
and to evaluate vocational aspirations and interests.
All majors are encouraged to do independent research culminating in a
senior thesis; this is especially recommended for students intending to
go on to graduate or professional school. The time to begin discussing
possible projects with faculty is during the second semester of the
junior year. The department chairperson should be consulted for further
details. Our web site has additional information.
Departmental Honors

To be eligible for departmental honors, students must have at least a
3.5 GPA in the major. In addition, students pursuing honors must take
ANTH or SOC 399 and write a thesis during their senior year. Awarding
of departmental honors is contingent on both the quality of the thesis, as
judged by a department committee, and the candidate's GPA at time of
graduation.

service organizations, activists, policymakers, legal professionals, and
government officials have focused massive reform efforts and political
agendas to tackle inequality in education. Many sociologists have long
viewed education not just as an arena of inequality but as the solution
to the widespread inequalities they see reflected in society. Urban
education has been an especially complex and controversial subject of
scrutiny in recent scholarly and popular debates. This course will focus

Teaching, Learning, and Technology

5-YEAR MASTER OF EDUCATION IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION AND
PREK-4 TEACHER CERTIFICATION

The Teaching, Learning and Technology (TLT) program offers six
master’s degrees and one graduate certificate, divided into two areas:
teacher education and instructional technology. The program also offers
a doctoral degree.

The College of Education offers a five-year degree program that is
designed to allow students to earn both a bachelor’s degree and
a master’s degree in five years instead of the traditional six. The
combined degree program leads to either a B.A. or B.S. degree in an
academic discipline from the College of Arts and Sciences, the P.C.
Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, or the College
of Business and Economics, and an M.Ed. degree in Elementary
Education. In addition, students also earn eligibility for an Instructional
I teaching certificate from the Pennsylvania Department of Education
(PDE) in grades PreK-4.

The master’s degrees in teacher education are Master of Education
in Elementary Education and PreK-4 Teacher Certification, Master of
Education (or Master of Arts) in Secondary Education and Teacher
Certification, and Master of Education (or Master of Arts) in Teaching
and Learning. Undergraduate students at Lehigh may also enroll
in a five-year program for a Master of Education in Elementary
Education and PreK-4 Certification or Master of Education in Secondary
Education and Teacher Certification, in addition to their undergraduate
degree. Teacher education students may elect to complete additional
coursework to earn certification in Special Education, as well as
Elementary Education or their Secondary Education field. All teacher
certification programs have been approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education, making graduates eligible for initial
certification in Pennsylvania.
In instructional technology TLT offers a Master of Science in
Instructional Technology and a Lehigh graduate certificate in Technology
Use in the Schools. This certificate is endorsed by the International
Society for Technology in Education (ISTE).
Finally, the program offers a Doctor of Philosophy in Teaching, Learning,
and Technology, which spans both fields of teacher education and
instructional technology.
The TLT program prepares professional educators through a
combination of graduate-level education and certification experiences.
The program highlights research-based, inquiry-oriented, and

In order to be eligible for PreK-4 certification, by the time a student
finishes the program he or she must have demonstrated competence in
the core content areas for that certification. At time of acceptance, each
student will be informed of any additional content-area coursework he or
she will be required to complete in order to demonstrate competence in
the PreK-4 core content areas. The student is responsible for completing
this coursework prior to applying for PreK-4 certification. The credits for
this coursework are not included in the master’s degree.
Distribution of coursework across undergraduate and graduate study:
Sophomore Year (3 credit hours)

In order to be eligible for secondary certification, by the time a student
finishes the program he or she must have demonstrated competence
in the subject matter area of that certification. Each student upon
admission meets with the content-area specialist in the field in which
that student seeks secondary certification. The content-area specialist,
who is a faculty member in the College of Arts and Sciences, reviews
the student’s transcripts and compares that student’s coursework with
the content-area guide sheet approved by the Pennsylvania Department
of Education (PDE). Following this audit, the content-area specialist
will identify what additional coursework in the content-area is needed, if
any. The student is responsible for completing this coursework prior to
applying for secondary certification. The credits for this course work are
not included in the M.Ed. degree.

5-YEAR MASTER OF EDUCATION IN SECONDARY EDUCATION AND
7-12 TEACHER CERTIFICATION

The College of Education offers a five-year degree program that is
designed to allow students to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a
master’s degree in five years instead of the traditional six.
The combined degree program leads to (1) a B.A./B.S. degree in an
academic discipline from the College of Arts and Sciences, the P.C.
Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, or the College
of Business and Economics, and (2) an M.Ed. degree in Secondary
Education. In addition, students also earn eligibility for Instructional I
teacher certification from the Pennsylvania Department of Education
(PDE) in one of the 8 subject areas below:

Students in the secondary teacher-preparation program are expected to
have completed almost all their content area coursework prior to going
out to student teach. This is important because student teachers need
to have mastery of their content in order to fulfill their responsibilities to
their students and to derive maximum benefit from the student teaching
experience.

Doctor of Philosophy in Teaching, Learning, and Technology

A 48-credit, post-master’s doctoral degree offered through the Teaching,
Learning, and Technology program.
The doctorate in Teaching, Learning, and Technology (TLT) is a 48credit, post master's Ph.D. program. The TLT Ph.D. program employs a
scientist/practitioner model of learning. That is, research is not separate
from application or practice. Our doctoral students collaborate closely
with faculty to generate new theories and classification systems,
innovative curricula, technology-integrated learning environments,
authentic approaches to assessing learning, and a wide range of
creative methods of teaching and learning in a global world highly
interconnected by technology.
In keeping with the scientist/practitioner model, our doctoral students
learn through innovative approaches, including research-based
strategies for curriculum delivery, synchronous and asynchronous
environments, and a wide range of other technology-enhanced designs
and approaches for learning. Students take about 42 credits of
coursework in addition to their qualifying examination preparation,
doctoral research project, and dissertation project. Coursework is
individualized according to the concentration students decide to pursue.
Also, many of the course assignments are project-based, which will
allows students to apply concepts they are learning to their particular
area of interest. In addition, the choice of research topic and projects is
also up to the student --in consultation with his/her faculty adviser and
within the broader context of the field, of course.

Technical Entrepreneurship Program
The Technical Entrepreneurship (TE) program helps students develop
the entrepreneurial mindset needed to create, refine and commercialize
new products and services, whether in an established company or
a start-up. Students enrolled in TE courses learn by experiencing
the idea-to-venture process in an education environment that is
hard-wired to support the development of novel, innovative, and
commercially-viable technologies. The TE programs are based on
our 20 years of experience with Lehigh's award-winning Integrated
Product Development (IPD) program. In 2012 IPD was recognized
by the National Academy of Engineering for providing real-world

417

entrepreneurial experiences to our students. In 2015 the IPD named
courses were replaced by TE 211 and TE 212.
TE Undergraduate Program

At the undergraduate level the technical entrepreneurship program
offers introductory skill building courses, such as TE 250: Creativity
Methods, and TE 304: Software Ventures, as well as capstone projects
courses such as TE 211/212: Capstone Design Projects I/ II. While

Theatre
To study theatre is to examine its many internal disciplines. Acting and
directing combine with design, technical theatre, dramatic literature and
theatre history to form the body of our art. Students may pursue general
theatre studies or focus on particular areas such as performance,
design or history and literature. They may major in theatre, minor in
theatre or participate strictly in our production program. Students may
even complete a minor in theatre from outside the College of Arts and
Sciences.
The bachelor of arts degree in theatre is granted after at least 48
credit hours of study. Because we believe that undergraduate theatre
education should be broad based with an emphasis on diversity of
experience, students are encouraged to take a variety of courses
outside the major. Many students complete double majors. Those
with the talents and aspirations for a career in theatre have gone to
graduate schools offering intense, pre-professional training. Other
majors who have not pursued a theatrical career have gone from
our program directly into careers in business, social services, sales.
Theatre study is an excellent preparation for vocations in which self
presentation is important, such as law. The problem solving, analytical
and interpersonal skills gained from this discipline are applicable across
a wide range of careers. An understanding and appreciation of the
complex art of the theatre will enrich a lifetime.
The department’s active production program is curricular and promotes
collaborative projects involving students, faculty, staff and guest artists.
Our large performance facility is the Diamond Theater, a 300-seat
thrust theatre housed in the Zoellner Arts Center. The core of our work
in this space is dedicated to productions featuring primarily student
actors directed by faculty or guest artists. When possible, a highly
qualified student may direct or design in this space. In addition to our
own productions, we regularly invite outside professional performers and
ensembles to work with us and perform. We also operate a lab theatre
(Fowler Black Box Theater) for student and faculty experimentation.
The availability of valuable hands-on experience and the very close
working relationships developed between students and faculty uniquely
characterize the department of theatre. The department enjoys a special
relationship with Bethlehem’s professional theatre company, Touchstone
Theatre. Performance and administrative internships with the company
are available to qualified students and the department and Touchstone
often collaborate on workshops and seminars.

TE 406 Entrepreneurial Startup Projects-2 3 Credits

consult with the department chairperson. Experienced theatre students
with questions regarding accurate placement in any theatre course
should, likewise, consult with the chairperson.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) at Lehigh University
is an interdisciplinary field of academic inquiry that critically examines
gender and sexuality from an intersectional model that takes
into account the manner in which class, race, and power coconstitutively shape and impact gendered and sexed identity
construction. In the best tradition of a liberal arts education, Women,
Gender, and Sexuality Studies encourages thinking that is critical and
constructive, multifaceted and intersectional in order to redesign
knowledge, and gain a better understanding of how identities shape
and are shaped by the social world in which we live. Offering an
undergraduate major and minor, a Graduate Certificate, and a host of
faculty and student-focused events and resources, WGSS works to be a
space of professional growth, intellectual development and maturity, and
a knowledge leader on campus, in the surrounding Lehigh Valley, and
abroad.
UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN WOMEN, GENDER, AND SEXUALITY
STUDIES

The Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies BA will provide students
an in depth education in an interdisciplinary field of academic inquiry
that critically examines the diverse realities of women's lives and the
ways in which gender and power differentials shape human lives and
human societies. WGSS pursues a fundamental critique of knowledge
by challenging the basic assumptions, methods of inquiry, theoretical
frameworks, and knowledge claims of traditional fields of inquiry that
have thought it unimportant to study women, gender, or sexuality.
WGSS seeks to create new paradigms of knowledge and inquiry, to
develop more truthful and comprehensive understandings of humans
and our world, and to explore nonsexist alternatives for more richly
human lives and more fully human social orders.

UNDERGRADUATE MINOR IN WOMEN, GENDER, AND SEXUALITY
STUDIES

The minor in WGSS engages students in the study of three interrelated
subjects. The first is an examination of the cultural, historical, and social
experiences and contributions of women. The second is an exploration
of gender (the social construction of differential identity for males and
females) and of the ways in which gender distinctions shape human

Lehigh University 2016-2017

consciousness and human society. The third is an examination of sex/
gender and sexuality systems.

COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

Nearly all academic disciplines have defined human nature and
significant achievement in terms of male experience and have
underestimated the impact of gender on social structures and
human lives. By contrast, WGSS courses attend to women's diverse
experiences and perspectives and acknowledge the critical significance
of gender and sexuality. By shifting the focus to women, gender,
and sexuality, WGSS seeks to provide an alternative paradigm for
understanding human experience. Students in WGSS courses are
encouraged to reevaluate traditional assumptions about human beings,
human knowledge, and human culture and society, and to explore
nonsexist alternatives for a more fully human social order.

The Graduate Certificate in WGSS is designed as a complement to a
disciplinary graduate program or as a standalone post-baccalaureate
course of study. The Certificate is a small, flexible program that provides
students with breadth and the challenge of working outside their home
discipline in concentrated interdisciplinary study of women and gender.
In recognition of contemporary educational and employment contexts
that are increasingly diverse and international, the WGSS Program
offers the graduate certificate as a means to enrich academic, personal,
and employment horizons. A certificate in WGSS will be especially
beneficial to those who wish to incorporate a broader perspective into
their teaching (either in secondary or higher education), and qualifies
them for positions that require such expertise. Additionally, individuals
interested in fields such as social policy, human resources, and business
will also gain from understanding how gender operates at individual,
organizational, and institutional levels. Students will work closely with
outstanding faculty from diverse disciplinary backgrounds.

An Overview from Past and Present

An Overview from Past and Present
Lehigh University is independent, nondenominational, and
coeducational. Founded in 1865 as a predominantly technical four-year
school, the university now has approximately 4,700 undergraduates
within its three major units, the College of Arts and Sciences, the
College of Business and Economics, and the P. C. Rossin College
of Engineering and Applied Science, and approximately 2,100
students enrolled in graduate programs offered through the graduate
schools in these colleges and in the College of Education. There are
undergraduates from nearly every state and U.S. territory and more than
40 foreign nations.
The university is primarily situated on the Asa Packer Campus on the
north slope of South Mountain overlooking Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
Sayre Park, the wooded refuge located toward the top of the mountain,
is the setting for many living groups. The residences are reached via
winding private roads. Many residential units on campus command
a panoramic view of the Lehigh Valley. The Appalachians are visible
to the west, with an especially good view from The Lookout on the
Packer Campus. Both the tower and dining room in Iacocca Hall on the
Mountaintop Campus afford panoramic views of the Lehigh Valley. The
campus at its highest point is 971 feet above sea level.

The site that Packer chose for his university was a railroad junction
across the Lehigh River from Bethlehem, a community founded in 1741
by Moravian missionaries. William Bacon Stevens, Episcopal bishop of
the Diocese of Pennsylvania and the first president of the university’s
board of trustees, in 1869 described the origin of the university as
follows:
“In the fall of 1864 an interview was requested of me by the Hon. Asa
Packer, of Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe), Pa. He came to my house in
Philadelphia, and said that he had long contemplated doing something
for the benefit of his State, and especially of the Lehigh Valley. From
that valley he said he had derived much of the wealth which GOD had
given to him, and to the best interests of that valley he wished to devote
a portion of it in the founding of some educational institution, for the
intellectual and moral improvement of the young men of that region.

A substantial portion of the upper level of Lehigh’s campus is maintained
as a nature preserve. The preserve supports deer, squirrels, chipmunks,
raccoons, wild turkeys, and other birds.

“After conversing with him a little while, and drawing out his large
and liberal views, I asked him how much money he proposed to set
aside for this institution, when he quietly answered that he deigned to
give $500,000. At the time of this interview no one in this country, it is
believed, had offered in a single sum such an endowment for a literary
institution. It was the noblest offering which an American had ever laid
on the altar of learning, and more than equaled many royal donations
which have carried down the names of kings as patrons of European
universities.

Besides the Asa Packer Campus, the university has extensive athletic
fields and facilities on the Murray H. Goodman Campus, two miles to
the south in Saucon Valley. The university acquired the Mountaintop
Campus in 1986; it linked the Packer and Goodman campuses. In 2012,
the university received a gift from the Donald B. and Dorothy L. Stabler
Foundation: 755 acres in nearby Upper Saucon Township. That brought
total land holdings to 2,358 acres, making Lehigh one of the largest
private universities in the country.

“Filled with profound emotions at the mention of such a gift for such an
object, I asked the noble donor what specific plans he had dreamed in
his own mind in reference to it. His reply was, ‘I am not much acquainted
with these matters, but you are, and I want you if you will to devise a
plan which I can put into effective operation.’ I told him that I would make
the attempt. I did so. I drew up the outline sketch of such an institution
as I thought would give the largest results for the means used, and
submitted it in a few weeks to his inspection.

The board of trustees and university officers have established and
enforce policies designed to preserve Lehigh’s natural beauty. It is their
contention that the environment in which the young adult university
student pursues knowledge can make the total educational experience
more meaningful, and that the ideal environment is separate and unique
from the distractions of the nonacademic community.

“He examined it with the practical judgment and business habits with
which he deals with all great questions, and adopted the scheme as the
basis of his future university.

There are approximately 480 full-time members of the faculty, teaching
a total of more than 2,000 course titles (not all of which are offered every
semester). Among faculty members who are tenured and to whom the
university has a permanent commitment, nearly all hold the doctorate
degree (typically Ph.D. or Sc.D.).

The trustees followed several principles in setting up the university.
One was that of combining scientific and classical education. They
considered both to be practical. The principle carried forward an ideal
th
of the great 17 century Moravian educator, John Amos Comenius. A
motto taken from the works of Francis Bacon was used to summarize
this principle, namely, Homo minister et interpres naturae — man, the
servant and interpreter of nature, to use a free translation. That motto
lives on at Lehigh, being an element in the university seal.

In total, there are more than 2,000 employees of the university, making it
the second-largest employer in the community.

History and Purpose
The principal author of the brief history of Lehigh University that follows,
Dr. W. Ross Yates, holds the bachelor of arts and master of arts
degrees from the University of Oregon, his native state. He received
the doctor of philosophy degree from Yale University and studied in
France on a Fulbright Scholarship. He joined the Lehigh staff in 1955
and served as dean of the College of Arts and Science from 1963 to
1972.
When the sound of the last cannon of the Civil War died away,
statesmen, educators, and industrial pioneers marshalled the victorious
forces of the North and turned their attention to education. They wanted
to increase the number of trained scientists, engineers, and other skilled
people so they could transform the vast natural resources of the country
into a strong and independent national economy.
Asa Packer was one of the industrial pioneers. He built the Lehigh Valley
Railroad and controlled a coalmining empire in the mountains of eastern
Pennsylvania. He knew, as did many others, that a strong national
economy depended on more than technical skills. It needed above all
people broadly educated in the liberal arts and sciences — people who
could combine practical skills with informed judgments and strong moral
self-discipline. He kept this in mind when founding and endowing Lehigh
University.

“The first meeting of the Board of Trustees, selected by Judge Packer,
met at the Sun Hotel, in Bethlehem, July 27th, 1865, and began to
organize the work before them.”

The trustees chose as first president a man whose education and habits
expressed this principle, Henry Coppee. They established five schools,
including a school of general literature in addition to four scientific
schools of, respectively, civil engineering, mechanical engineering,
mining and metallurgy, and analytical chemistry.
Another principle upon which the trustees insisted was that of keeping
the size of the student body proportionate to the abilities of the faculty
to teach them well. The university would admit only as many freshmen
each year as it could be assured of providing with the highest quality
of education. In the 19th century the total enrollment never exceeded
several hundred students; the size has increased significantly in recent
decades, along with the number of faculty members.
The trustees also insisted that Lehigh was to be nondenominational
and would have an admission policy based on merit. Competitive
examinations were held for applicants for admission. From 1871 to 1891
no tuition was charged, but the national financial crisis at the turn of the
century decimated the value of the Lehigh Valley Railroad stock that
Packer had given to Lehigh, which was the principal source of income.
At first the student body was entirely male. The contemporary ideological
climate would permit nothing else. But around 1916, women were
admitted to graduate programs. In 1971, the university opened its

Lehigh University 2016-2017

undergraduate program to them as well. Today men and women
applicants are considered on an equal basis.
From the first, the students were serious-minded. In 1924, Catherine
Drinker Bowen, daughter of president Drinker and later a famous
biographer, published a brief history of Lehigh University, in which she
commented:
“Ask any college professor which brand of boy he would prefer to teach,
the cigarette brand or the flannel shirt variety. Right here we offer ten
to one the flannel shirts...Lehigh still holds to the emblem of the flannel
shirt—long may it wave! Engineers come to college to work. A writer
in the Syracuse Post in 1895 spoke truthfully when he said, ‘From the
first, Lehigh’s characteristic has been her earnestness. It is the boast
of her graduates, the inspiration of her students. Men go there to learn
to take a useful part in the economy of life.’” The university community
was constantly infused with new faculty and students determined to
renew and rework the original principles in the light of changing times.
The students’ ambition and zeal bore fruit; as alumni they carried the
university’s educational goals into the work of nation-building. And,
having received, they gave to perpetuate Lehigh’s work of service.
Today, Lehigh University still adheres to Asa Packer’s goal of a liberal
and scientific education for practical service. Faculty and students work
to maintain high quality in instructional programs. Generous support
from individuals, foundations, industry, and government help Lehigh
to retain high quality of education and faculty while keeping tuition
as low as possible. (Tuition covers only a part of the cost of a Lehigh
education.)

Presidents of the University
The presidents of Lehigh University are described and their
achievements cited in the following paragraphs. The years in
parentheses are those served in the presidency.
Henry Coppee (1866-1875). Coppee served as a railroad engineer in
Georgia, a captain in the Army during the Mexican War, and taught at
West Point and at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming first
president in 1866.
Much building was done on the new university campus. A Moravian
church on Packer Avenue was remodeled into Christmas Hall; a house
for the president was erected on campus; and Packer Hall, the university
center, was built.
Coppee lectured in history, logic, rhetoric, political economy, and
Shakespeare.
John McDowell Leavitt (1875-1880). Leavitt was an Episcopal
clergyman who graduated from Jefferson College and taught at Kenyon
College and Ohio University. During his incumbency, the university was
divided into two schools, General Literature and Technology. As of 1876,
a student could receive two engineering degrees by taking a longer
course, and beginning in 1877 the master of arts, doctor of philosophy,
and doctor of science degrees were established.
Linderman Library rotunda was completed in 1877. Asa Packer died
in May 1879, and Founder’s Day was held in his honor the following
October.
Robert Alexander Lamberton (1880-1893). Lamberton, a graduate of
Dickinson College, practiced law in Harrisburg, Pa., and was a university
trustee when asked to become president. During his administration,
students and the community witnessed the first Mustard and Cheese
dramatic presentation.
A gymnasium (now Coppee Hall) was erected, and Chandler Chemistry
Laboratory was built, now known as Chandler-Ullmann Hall. Lehigh was
also building its reputation for academic excellence; the mechanical
engineering department was established in 1881 and the Lehigh chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1887.
Thomas Messinger Drown (1895-1904). Drown studied medicine at
the University of Pennsylvania and went abroad to study chemistry.
Thereafter he was professor of chemistry at Lafayette College. In 1895
he assumed the presidency of Lehigh and was greatly interested in
furthering the university’s development as a technical school.
His first years were difficult ones because the Panic of 1893 decimated
the university’s stock holdings in the Lehigh Valley Railroad.

429

Nevertheless, Lehigh managed to grow in enrollment, academics, and in
physical plant. Williams Hall was completed. The curriculum leading to a
degree in arts and engineering was established, as was the department
of zoology and biology. New curricula were adopted in metallurgical
engineering, geology, and physics.
Drown died in office in 1904. Professor William H. Chandler became
acting president.
Henry Sturgis Drinker (1905-1920). Drinker, an 1871 Lehigh graduate,
was the only university alumnus ever to become president. In 1907,
the alumni endowment fund began, the Lehigh Alumni Bulletin was first
published in 1913, and the Alumni Association was incorporated in 1917.
Drinker, besides being a lawyer, was a mechanical engineer and had
been largely instrumental in solving the problems of constructing the
two-mile-long Musconetcong Tunnel, an engineering feat that made
possible a railroad line between Easton, Pa., and New York City. He
started a tradition of businesslike management of university affairs.
During Drinker’s years, more buildings were completed: the original
section of Fritz Engineering Laboratory, Drown Hall, Coxe Mining
Laboratory, Taylor Hall, Taylor Gymnasium and Field House, Taylor
Stadium, and Lamberton Hall. Drinker’s interest in horticulture led to the
planting of many rare trees and plants.
A teacher’s course and business administration course were begun
in 1909 and in 1918 the university was divided into three colleges:
liberal arts, business administration, and engineering — the roots of the
colleges of today. Army ROTC was established in 1919.
Drinker’s daughter, Catherine Drinker Bowen, went on to become a
historical writer of note. Her experiences as the daughter of a Lehigh
president and occupant of the President’s House are recorded in Family
Portrait (Atlantic Little-Brown).
Drinker resigned in 1920 and Natt M. Emery, vice president, served as
chief executive officer until 1922.
Charles Russ Richards (1922-1935). Richards took office in 1922.
During his presidency, the first graduate degrees were awarded to
women. Lehigh faced a shortage of students from 1929 to 1936 as a
result of the Depression, but the newly established office of admission,
as well as university scholarships, fellowships, and deferred tuition
payments, helped to ease the shortage.
Changing concepts of education were evident in several newly
organized academic offerings: philosophy, music, psychology,
journalism, history, and fine arts. The majors system was instituted as
were the senior comprehensive examinations in the Arts College. The
placement bureau, a public relations office, and a student health service
were organized.
The Alumni Memorial Building, a memorial to the Lehigh alumni who
served in World War I, was opened in 1925 and Packard Laboratory was
completed in 1929. In the same decade, a major addition to Linderman
Library also was completed.
Clement C. Williams (1935-1944). Williams, a civil engineer,
was president during an era of unprecedented alumni support.
Undergraduate enrollment rose to an all-time high, passing 2,000 in
1938. Richards and Drinker residential houses, and the Ullmann wing
adjoining the Chandler Chemistry Laboratory, were built. Grace Hall,
the first arena-type facility of any size on campus, was completed in
1940, the gift of Eugene G. Grace, an 1899 graduate, who headed the
board of trustees. A Graduate School implemented the programs in the
three colleges. Williams retired in 1944, and the university was without a
president for approximately two years.
Martin Dewey Whitaker (1946-1960). Dr. Whitaker, who had been
director of the Atomic Energy Commission Laboratory at Oak Ridge,
Tenn., and had worked in developing the atomic bomb, faced the
responsibility of helping the university community readjust to peacetime
conditions after World War II.
During his time as president, Lehigh’s assets nearly tripled; the
endowment more than doubled to $18 million. Many buildings were
renovated, and the Dravo House and McClintic-Marshall House
residence halls were built. The faculty increased in number by 75
percent and the first endowed distinguished professorships were
established.

430

Presidents of the University

The Centennial development program was begun in 1959. It raised more
than $22 million for faculty salaries and construction that later included
Whitaker Laboratory.

Also dedicated was the Sherman Fairchild Center for the Physical
Sciences, which includes the renovated Physics Building (renamed
Lewis Lab), and the adjoining Sherman Fairchild Lab.

An extensive renovation and enlargement project associated with
Packer Hall was undertaken in 1957, and, upon completion in 1958, the
building became a university center.

Lehigh became home to the Northeast Tier Ben Franklin Advanced
Technology Center, which has helped hundreds of new high-technology
businesses get started. And the university led the way in establishing
the Colonial League, now the Patriot League, in football. The league is
committed to the Lehigh tradition of scholar-athletes.

Whitaker died in office.
Harvey A. Neville (1961-1964). Dr. Neville was the only faculty member
ever elected president. His association with the university began in 1927
as an assistant professor of chemistry. During his three-year term as
president, the first phase of the Saucon Valley athletic complex was
completed, and Sayre Field was opened atop South Mountain. The
Center for Information and Computing Science was established.
Neville, a strong supporter of research who fostered its growth on the
campus, died in 1983.
Deming Lewis (1964-1982). Willard Deming Lewis became Lehigh’s
10th president after a distinguished career as a space engineer and
research administrator.
Dr. Lewis earned three degrees at Harvard and two from England’s
Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar in advanced
mathematics. In 1941, he joined Bell Telephone Laboratories, and
in 1962 he became general manager of systems development with
Bellcomm Inc., which engineered systems for the Apollo project that
placed the first man on the moon.
Lewis, who died in 1989, received 33 U.S. patents on such devices as
microwave antennas and filter and digital error detection systems. He
helped write the equations describing a stylus sliding through a warped
groove.
During Lewis’ tenure as Lehigh president, women were admitted as
undergraduate students in 1971. New majors were begun in natural
science, biology, social relations, geological sciences, environmental
science and resource management, religion studies, computer
engineering, computing and information science, applied mathematics,
management science, American studies, and other fields. Six research
centers and seven institutes were established.
Capital campaigns brought in more than $130 million, and construction
was completed on Maginnes Hall, Whitaker Lab, Mart Science and
Engineering Library, Sinclair Lab, the Seeley G. Mudd Building, Neville
Hall, Rathbone Hall dining room, 13 fraternity houses, the Centennial I
and Centennial II residential complexes, the Brodhead House residence
hall, the Trembley Park student apartments, the Saucon Village
Apartments, the Philip Rauch Field House, and the Stabler Athletic and
Convocation Center. The restoration of Packer Memorial Church was
completed, and Packard Lab was renovated.
The original Physics Laboratory is now named in Lewis’ honor, as is the
indoor tennis center.
Peter Likins (1982-1997). Dr. Likins, who earned a B.S. and Ph.D. from
Stanford, and an M.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
became Lehigh’s 11th president in 1982. He sought balanced excellence
in undergraduate programs while pursuing focused objectives in
graduate study and research.
Under Likins, Lehigh nearly doubled in size with the purchase in 1986 of
742 acres of land and a research complex from Bethlehem Steel Corp.
The new Mountaintop Campus links the Asa Packer and Goodman
campuses.
Lehigh also added many new buildings and facilities. Perhaps most
notable was the $33 million Zoellner Arts Center, which provided a new
home to Lehigh’s departments of music and theatre and to the University
Art Galleries, and made Lehigh a center for the fine arts. The arts center
and the new Rauch Business Center, home of the College of Business
and Economics, were built on the site of Taylor Stadium, which was
replaced by Goodman Stadium on Lehigh’s athletic campus.
Also during Likins’ term, Lehigh built a $20 million, state-of-the-art
telecommunications system, the E.W. Fairchild-Martindale Library and
Computing Center, one of the most automated libraries anywhere, and
the Harold S. Mohler Lab, which honors the former chairman of the
board of trustees.

Financial support grew from $10 million a year to over $24 million. With
over half of alumni making gifts, Lehigh ranked among the top Ph.D.granting schools in percentage of alumni donors.
Likins’ term also saw the establishment of the Lehigh Valley Center for
Jewish Studies at Lehigh, the Center for Advanced Technology for Large
Structural Systems, largest of its kind in North America, and centers in
integrated circuits, management studies, chemical process modeling
and control, and international studies.
Likins, an expert in spacecraft dynamics and control who has written
textbooks in engineering mechanics, was one of 13 science advisers to
President George H.W. Bush. He came to Lehigh after serving as dean
of engineering and provost at Columbia, and left to become president of
the University of Arizona.
William C. Hittinger (1997-1998). A former chairman of the university’s
board of trustees, Hittinger became interim president after the departure
of Peter Likins. A member of the National Academy of Engineering,
Hittinger served for 22 years on the board of trustees. He graduated
from Lehigh in 1944 with a B.S. in metallurgical engineering, and
received an honorary doctor of engineering degree from Lehigh in 1973.
Over a 40-year career in the electronics industry, Hittinger worked
for Western Electric Co., National Union Radio Corp., Bell Telephone
Laboratories, Bellcomm Inc., General Instrument Corp., and RCA Corp.
At Bellcomm, he oversaw systems engineering for NASA’s manned
spaceflight program, and at RCA, where he became executive vice
president, he was responsible for corporate technology, patents,
licensing, international business and marketing development, and
corporate technology planning.
Hittinger was a member of President Reagan’s National Security
Telecommunications Advisory Committee from 1982-86. He was also
a member of the U.S.-Brazil Presidential Committee on Science and
Technology and a member of the board of directors for eight companies.
Hittinger served as national president of the Lehigh Alumni Association
in 1971-72 and received the prestigious L-in-Life Award in 1979. An
ROTC student at Lehigh, he served in the U.S. Army in 1943-46 during
World War II, rising to the rank of captain.
During Hittinger’s term as chairman of the board of trustees, Lehigh
began construction of the Zoellner Arts Center, completed the
Ulrich Student Center, aggressively improved its financial aid for
undergraduates, and completed the $300 million Campaign for
Preserving The Vision. As president, Hittinger realigned the Iacocca
Institute into the College of Business and Economics, oversaw the
construction of the new Sayre Park Village residential complex, and
helped Lehigh move forward during a time of presidential transition.
Gregory C. Farrington (1998-2006). Dr. Farrington was appointed
Lehigh’s 12th president in May 1998 and served the university for
eight years before stepping down in June 2006. Proclaiming on many
occasions that “the only thing good enough for Lehigh is the best,”
Farrington promoted academic excellence, improved facilities, and
fostered collaborative relationships between Lehigh and the surrounding
community.
Farrington earned his B.S. from Clarkson University and his A.M. and
Ph.D. from Harvard, all in chemistry and specializing in solid state
electrochemistry. Before joining the University of Pennsylvania’s
Department of Materials Science and Engineering in 1979, he was a
research chemist for General Electric Company’s Corporate Research
and Development Center in New York State. At Penn, he served as

Lehigh University 2016-2017

While at Lehigh, Farrington established the university’s bold and creative
Lehigh 2020 Initiative. Launched in October 2000, the $75-million
academic venture capital fund focused investment on attracting and
retaining the best faculty and students, creating distinctive academic
programs, funding critical research fields, and stimulating crosscurricular collaboration. New programs created through the 2020
program include those in bioscience, bioengineering, applied life
science, computer science and engineering, information systems and
engineering, and bioeconomics.
Along with the reinvigoration of academics and the promotion of
interdisciplinary learning, Farrington also literally changed the face of
Lehigh’s historic campus. More than 20 major campus enhancement
projects were completed during his term, among them the construction
of Campus Square, a new Alumni Building Arrival Court and parking
garage, and a pedestrian walkway through the heart of the campus
green, transforming it into a central gathering place. In addition, Coppee
Hall, Lamberton Hall, Maginnes Hall, Wilbur Powerhouse, Grace Hall,
the A. Haigh Cundey Varsity House, and Linderman Library were
renovated.

University Campuses
Lehigh University’s three campuses are located in Bethlehem, Pa., and
comprise 1,600 acres.
Asa Packer Campus. Lehigh’s main academic campus, encompassing
approximately 360 acres on the north slope of South Mountain
overlooking Bethlehem, is a wooded area where most students attend
class and live. This contains the original campus of the university.
Murray H. Goodman Campus. During the 1960s, the university
acquired extensive acreage in the Saucon Valley just south of South
Mountain. Development of one of the nation’s finest collegiate athletic
complexes has continued since that time. The 500-acre campus now
includes the Murray H. Goodman Stadium and other athletic fields, as
well as the 6,000-seat Stabler Athletic and Convocation Center, the
Philip Rauch Field House, the Cundey Varsity House, the Lewis Indoor
Tennis Facility, and the Ulrich Sports Complex. The campus is named
for a major benefactor, Lehigh alumnus Murray H. Goodman, of West
Palm Beach, Fla.
Mountaintop Campus. Lehigh bought this campus from Bethlehem
Steel Corp. in 1986. It contains 670 acres of woods and a 72-acre
research site with 8 buildings, including a landmark tower building visible
for miles around. Acquisition of the facilities connected the two older
campuses. The Mountaintop Campus houses the College of Education;

University Buildings
th

Lehigh has a major collection of 19 century buildings designed by such
prominent architects as Addison Hutton (1834-1916), Edward T. Potter
(1831-1904), A. W. Leh (1848-1918), and the firm of Furness and Evans
(Frank Furness, 1839-1912).
Zoellner Arts Center (1996), designed by Dagit Saylor Architects and
located just east of the Rauch Business Center (1990), houses a 1,000seat music auditorium, a 300-seat theatre, a permanent art gallery and
museum store, and the departments of music and theatre. A 350-car
parking garage is on the same site.
The university has seen numerous buildings constructed and renovated
since 2000 on all three campuses. New Mountaintop construction
includes an addition to Iacocca Hall for biological sciences (2003),
and ongoing renovations in Building C (since 2013) for the Data X
Mountaintop Experience.
New construction on Goodman Campus includes the Mulvihill Golf
