A wide array of scientists, philosophers, and social critics (e.g., Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens) have challenged religion’s basic claims and provide alternative rational, scientifically grounded explanations. However, in many instances, these books fall short of the powerful critiques, previously formulated by philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche, or those of contemporary French philosophers Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. In this seminar, we shall explore in-depth the critiques of religion contained in the writings of Spinoza, Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Foucault and Deleuze.
